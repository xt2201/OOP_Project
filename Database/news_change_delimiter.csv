The SEC accused Terraform Labs and Kwon of misleading investors about the stability of its so-called “algorithmic” native stablecoin, Terra USD (UST), and the use cases for the Terra blockchain. The jury delivered the verdict on Friday, just two hours after lawyers for both the SEC and the defendants gave their closing arguments at the end of the nine-day trial in New York. Jurors agreed with the SEC that Kwon and, under his direction, Terraform Labs deceived everyday investors about the nature of the supposed algorithm that kept UST pegged to the U.S. dollar. Though Kwon insinuated that it could “automatically self-heal” in the event of a de-peg, it actually relied on continuous trading activity, including large-scale trading done by institutional investors. “We are pleased with today’s jury verdict holding Terraform Labs and Do Kwon liable for a massive crypto fraud,” Gurbir Grewal, SEC Division of Enforcement director, wrote in a statement. “The defendants caused devastating losses for investors and wiped out tens of billions of market value nearly overnight. For all of crypto’s promises, the lack of registration and compliance have very real consequences for real people. As the hard work of our team shows, we will continue to use the tools at our disposal to protect the investing public, but it is high time for the crypto markets to come into compliance,” Grewal added. SEC attorney Laura Meehan told the jury during her closing arguments on Friday that one of those institutional investors – Jump Trading – had made a secret deal with Kwon and Terraform Labs to rescue UST during a de-pegging event in May 2021, stepping in and buying millions of dollars of UST off-chain to reinflate its value and bring it back to parity with the dollar. Meehan added that, after Jump’s intervention, Kwon and his company intentionally kept the firm’s rescue mission quiet, wanting instead to use the re-pegging as evidence of the algorithm’s effectiveness. Lawyers for Terraform Labs and Kwon attempted to wave Jump’s involvement away as a regular part of their relationship with Terraform Labs as a market maker. They said that all “reasonable” investors knew that the algorithm that kept UST pegged to the dollar was not a “magical machine” or “computer that functioned on its own” but instead, minting and burning done by market participants. The jury, as evidenced by their verdict, did not agree. A spokesperson for Terraform Labs told CoinDesk: “We are very disappointed with the verdict, which we do not believe is supported by the evidence. We continue to maintain that the SEC does not have the legal authority to bring this case at all, and we are carefully weighing our options and next steps.” Kwon was not in Manhattan for his civil trial; instead, he was stuck in Montenegro, where he had been since his arrest in March 2023. Kwon was caught en route to Dubai attempting to use fake Costa Rican travel documents after months on the run. Kwon also faces criminal charges in the U.S. and his native South Korea, which are tied to the implosion of the Terra ecosystem. Both countries are currently vying for his extradition, but his final destination remains unclear as Montenegro's Supreme Court weighs the competing requests.

Halving, which occurs every four years, cuts bitcoin's supply growth by half, historically causing upward pressure on the price of the largest digital asset. The previous halving cycles pushed bitcoin to new highs, and this time, strong demand from the spot ETF may add even more fuel to the rally. “If we look at demand generally since the ETFs have launched, it has created tremendous supply shock already,” said Brian Dixon, CEO of investment firm Off the Chain Capital. “Once the halving occurs, and that supply is further reduced, it's only logical to think that the price will appreciate.” Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained On the surface, that may be the case as the demand from the funds has been significantly more than the 900 new BTC that are mined daily. And when that supply gets cut in half, it might create an even bigger pull on the prices. However, it might not play out the same way this time. The price of bitcoin had rallied 46% since Jan. 11, when the spot ETFs started trading in the U.S. The demand from these funds has been so strong that the price of the digital asset rallied to a new all-time high to keep up with the onslaught of bitcoin purchases. But the market may have gotten a bit ahead of itself in the hype. “This is the first time in which bitcoin broke its all-time highs before the halving, so there is a little bit of a concern that the ETFs have pulled demand forward and that maybe we're going to linger where we are for a little bit," said David Lawant, Head of Research at FalconX. Anthony Anderson, founder and CEO of Param Labs and Kiraverse, echoed this sentiment. "Bitcoin ETFs preempted the impact of halving on supply by massively acquiring BTC since the beginning of the year." Also, halving might not affect the ETF flows either due to the already strong demand from the investors, at least not in the short term, according to Bloomberg Intelligence's ETF analyst James Seyffart. Read More: Bitcoin Could Slump Around Reward Halving Time, Arthur Hayes Says "We know many miners use OTC desks to offload their BTC and the ETF issuers also use OTC desks to obtain their Bitcoin as flows come into the fund. So theoretically the potential halving of miner bitcoin sales could mean that ETF inflows will have a greater impact on the underlying market. But for the last few months the ETF inflows have vastly exceeded anything the miners provided from operations," he said. "So if it does have an impact it’s unlikely to be anything extremely impactful in my view," Seyffart added. This is not to say that halving won't be a significant catalyst for bitcoin and the ETF flows in the long term. After all, the success of the ETFs seems to be closely correlated to the price of BTC and vice versa. The halving may even accentuate the appeal of bitcoin as an asset class to institutional investors. “I think the halving is going to be one of the best things for bitcoin since the ETFs launched,” said Bob Iacchino, co-founder of analytics firm Path Trading Partners. “At its core is an inflation protection mechanism and inflation is ramping back up.” In fact, the hype around halving might help bitcoin bring it in front of many investors looking for alternative assets to hedge against the global macro volatility. "This [Halving] is happening at a time when folks are somewhat queasy about the risk that Bitcoin hedges against," said Lawant, pointing out that many investors are starting to pay more attention to how to protect their portfolio against any significant change in global economy and having spot ETF and an asset class with shrinking supply "would be positive for ETF flows." This supply shortage might also lead to a longer-term impact on the ETF flows as it will impact bitcoin's "marginal supply into perpetuity," said Seyffart. He added that, even though the impact of the marginal supply from ETF inflows in the first three months has been much higher than the halving can have, the slashing of the supply of BTC is "permanent and goes into perpetuity." Whatever the case may be, the market may need to brace for volatile short-term trading for bitcoin and perhaps for the ETF flow after the halving, said Anderson, noting that in the long term, net flows for the funds should come in at a similar pace that is seen currently.

The quadrennial halving is when miner rewards are reduced, slowing the rate of growth in bitcoin supply. Benchmark raised its MicroStrategy price target to $1,875 from $990 while maintaining its buy rating. The new price target is based on the assumption that bitcoin will reach $150,000 by the end of 2025, up from $125,000 previously. MicroStrategy shares rose more than 11% to around $1,601 in trading before the official open of U.S. markets. “While the upcoming bitcoin halving will create a supply shock as the previous ones had, we believe the event’s impact could be magnified by the concurrent demand shock created by the emergence of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs),” Palmer wrote, adding that “we expect inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs to grow dramatically once institutions begin to invest in them in earnest.” MicroStrategy has a unique business model based on the acquisition and holding of bitcoin. The company is expected to continue to add to its bitcoin stash using proceeds from capital markets transactions and excess cash generated by its enterprise software business, the report said. Benchmark estimates that the company will hold 298,246 bitcoins by year-end 2025, up from the 214,246 coins it owned as of March 19. Rival broker BTIG said the software developer’s implied premium to bitcoin is supported by investors who want exposure to digital assets but may be unable to invest directly in the cryptocurrency or ETFs, and also supported by the company’s ability to accretively raise capital to purchase additional BTC, it wrote in a report on Friday.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day. U.S. crypto-related stocks looked set to start the week on a positive note after bitcoin (BTC) climbed through $72,000 for the first time since mid-March as its reward halving draws closer. Coinbase (COIN), the only U.S. traded crypto exchange, gained 4.9% in pre-market trading, MicroStrategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, rose 10% and BlackRock’s bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT), added around 6.5%. Bitcoin advanced 4.4% over 24 hours while the CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the broader crypto market, rose 4.1%. Other tokens rising on Monday included meme coins dogwifhat, which gained 18%, and pepe, which rose 10%. According to trader Michaël van de Poppe, there is still a lot of momentum to be gained for altcoins as bitcoin dominance continues to peak pre-halving. “They [altcoins] are super undervalued,” van de Poppe said in a post on X. Bitcoin could soon rally to new record highs after breaking through a so-called triangle resistance, according to technical analysis by 10x Research. On its way to $72,000, BTC passed through a triangular consolidation pattern identified by a resistance line connecting March 15 and March 27 highs and a support line connecting March 20 and April 3 lows. "If the breakout is bullish, which we suspect, bitcoin could climb above 80,000 during the next few weeks – if not earlier. Buying at $69,280 and setting a stop loss at $65,000 appears appropriate," Markus Thielen, founder of 10X Research, said in a note sent to clients early Monday. BlackRock (BLK) added five authorized participants (APs) to the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), bringing the total number to nine as the exchange-traded fund continues to attract billions of dollars from investors. The new APs include Wall Street banking giants Goldman Sachs, Citadel Securities, Citigroup and UBS alongside clearing house ABN AMRO, according to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They join Jane Street Capital, JPMorgan, Masquarie and Virtu Americas. CoinDesk reported in January that Goldman Sachs was looking to play a key role for the bitcoin ETFs and was in talks with issuers about becoming an AP.

The “TOKEN Supercharge Program” will provide preferential treatment for TOKEN holders and stakers, allowing them to secure tokens ahead of the broader public if the proposal passes. The proposed move would further allow eligible users to acquire up to four times more tokens than the standard quota per wallet. Users who do not stake or hold TOKEN may face limited access to token sale events. Users must stake or hold a minimum of $1,000 worth of $TOKEN for the proposed priority access, with higher holdings offering additional advantages. “We have close to a dozen of these token launches already planned and due to be announced in the coming days and weeks,” TokenFi developer B told CoinDesk in a release. “However, we envision a scenario in which some of these token sale events could be sold out in minutes, especially if open to the general public.” This could result in the majority of $TOKEN stakers and holders being unable to participate in these events when they should be the main beneficiaries,” he added. TokenFi, which uses token (TOKEN) as its native digital asset, lets users launch any cryptocurrency without writing code. It was started in 2023 as a sister project to Floki, a former dog-themed meme coin that has since pivoted into a metaverse and decentralized finance platform. At the time of writing, TOKEN prices were little changed, trading at 16 cents, data shows. Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

6::https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/03/13/why-prime-brokers-could-be-a-source-of-crypto-contagion/::CoinDesk::article::Why Prime Brokers Could Be a Source of Crypto Contagion::Prime brokers are a new source of liquidity in this cycle, which could be good and bad in the long-run, says Phillip Moran, CEO of the Digital Opportunities Group.::Digital asset markets have been vibrant recently, and this has been a great respite after almost two years of crypto winter. I do not want to throw a wet towel on current sentiment, but it is good to remember that the seeds of the next crash are often sown during the good times. Because risk management is the primary job of all portfolio managers, here I want to opine on one potential scenario if this bull market continues for another 18-plus months. Here is why I think the potential nexus for future contagion could be prime brokers (PBs). Why? Because 1) PBs are emerging as a major player and lender in crypto markets and2) The current lending standards of PBs are tight, largely lending to low drawdown strategies (like delta-neutral), and presents low systemic risk. But, 3), if expected returns of delta-neutral strategies decline, then PBs may move out the risk curve in terms of who they are willing to lend to and what services they offer, which could brew systemic risk. During the last bullish cycle, lenders increased the violence of the implosions that we witnessed. Leverage was hidden across a network of entities (BlockFi, Voyager, etc.), with concentration at certain nodes (3AC, Alameda). The lenders of the old-world are largely gone, but there is a new source of liquidity: prime brokers (PBs). Currently, PBs generate most of their revenues through 1) trading revenues from market access, and 2) lending revenues from lending, typically to delta-neutral strategies. Funding arbitrage is a strategy which benefits from market demand to go long via derivatives. This exploits the funding interest rates paid out from perpetual swaps (a crypto derivative product) by going long on spot and short perpetual swaps (or vice versa). This generates attractive yields and exploits market demand to go levered long, while not exposing the strategy to directional market moves. If the strategy is implemented well, the risk is very low, which makes it a popular strategy for PBs to lend to. While funding rates are currently elevated from recent upside price action, I believe it is reasonable to expect the returns to come down as more money flows into these lower-risk strategies. With returns declining in funding arbitrage, we will likely see returns in other lower risk strategies fall. If expected returns decline below the borrow cost from PB loans, then the PBs will be forced to make the decision to move out the risk spectrum or reconsider their product offerings. What could this apocalyptic future fueled by crypto PB collapse look like? What could it be fueled by? Here are a couple ideas: Further aggregation of liquidity through PBs: Increasing volume requirements for better fee tiers at centralized exchanges, like Binance and OKX, will push most traders to access the market through PBs instead of their own master accounts. Synthetics, swaps, other derivatives: If trading directly on exchange becomes restricted (either due to the exchanges themselves limiting direct access, or the PBs limiting access), this may create a market of derivatives for traders where the PB will clear the other side (usually this is a swap mechanism). This opens the door for accounting issues, or leverage shenanigans. We should enjoy the good times while they are here, while also considering future disaster scenarios. Stay safe out there, everyone. Edited by Benjamin Schiller. Disclosure Please note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

7::https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/02/14/how-the-halving-could-impact-bitcoin/::CoinDesk::article::How the ‘Halving’ Could Impact Bitcoin::Bitcoin halvings have generally been good for the network. But price increases have decreased over time, says Todd Groth, head of research at CoinDesk Indices.::The new entrants coming into Bitcoin via the recently launched ETF and prices bounce back up towards $50,000, it’s a good time to dig a bit into the Bitcoin halving, as we’re expected to go into another halving event in mid-April. The Bitcoin halving cycle refers to the recurring event that reduces the blockchain rewards paid in bitcoin and given to miners for validating transactions and creating new blocks on the blockchain. This reduction occurs approximately every four years, specifically when the number of total blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain reaches a certain threshold, currently set at 210,000 blocks. You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. The halving event aims to maintain the scarcity of Bitcoin by gradually decreasing the rate at which new Bitcoins are introduced into circulation. Ultimately, this process will result in a total of 21 million Bitcoins being mined, with no more Bitcoins being generated after the final halving event. Read more: What Is the Bitcoin Halving? The general consensus is that Bitcoin halving events are positive for the price of Bitcoin, and historically they have been. The event often generates optimism among crypto investors, leading to positive price action afterward. This positive price movement can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the reduction in the supply issuance rate emphasizes Bitcoin's scarcity, which can drive up demand and consequently increase its price. Additionally, the halving event brings attention to the crypto space, attracting new investors and contributing to increased trading activity. However, it's important to note that while the halving historically has led to price increases, the magnitude of these increases may diminish with each subsequent halvings. To look more closely into the effects Bitcoin halving periods have had on distribution of returns, we looked back from July 2010 to February 2024 utilizing the CoinDesk Indices Bitcoin XBX Price Index, and compare the distribution of weekly returns of each halving period as bitcoin increased in value from 0.1 to recent levels of 50k USD per BTC. (Source: CoinDesk Indices, Investing.com) July 2010 - October 2014 period utilizes BTCUSD pricing from Investing.com; Return outliers of 0.5% and 99.5% were removed for sake of distribution illustrative purposes. (Source: CoinDesk Indices, Investing.com) From the overlay of these distributions, and comparison of annual return and volatility, we can see that as the distribution of returns has narrowed as the bitcoin market has matured from a crypto enthusiast hobby to a real asset with institutional interest. This evolution can also be seen in the decrease in both returns and volatility over each subsequent halving, while Return per Volatility has held more constant after the first halving. This evolution suggests that investors should not expect similar performance gains in Bitcoin that were experienced when the market was in its early stages prior to 2012. One area of the market that is directly affected by the halving event is the Bitcoin miners, via an immediate halving of block rewards for new blocks. This reduction in mining rewards can impact miners' revenue and profitability, as miners could face increased competition and higher operational costs, potentially leading to consolidation within the mining sector. Smaller miners may struggle to remain profitable, while larger players with greater resources, cheaper sources of electricity and economies of scale may dominate the industry. Looking beyond the halving events, the future of Bitcoin mining will eventually transition to relying solely on transaction fees once all 21 million Bitcoins have been mined. This shift will occur approximately 31 years after Bitcoin's inception. Miners will need to adapt to this change towards relying solely on transaction fees, although this will be a gradual change from each halving. Innovations in the crypto space, such as additional protocols and tokens that coexist alongside Bitcoin (e.g. Ordinals), may provide opportunities for miners to diversify and optimize their mining operations to maintain revenue beyond Bitcoin block rewards. We’ve come a long way in the evolution of Bitcoin from a cypherpunk and cryptography enthusiast hobby to a digitally-scarce store of value with its own spot ETFs and regulated derivative markets. That said, through market cycles, and increases in market capitalization, the volatility of the asset has decreased. So we should taper our expectations when analyzing historical halving cycles, as Bitcoin holders today are very different from holders in 2010. Edited by Benjamin Schiller.

8::https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/02/07/diversifying-stability-stablecoins-finding-home-beyond-the-greenback/::CoinDesk::article::Diversifying Stability: Stablecoins Finding Home Beyond the Greenback::Following the success of Tether and USDC, a generation of stablecoins are offering new features for investors and holders, says Scott Sunshine, Managing Partner of Blue Dot Advisors.::Stablecoins, the backbone of the cryptocurrency market, with their $135 billion market cap, have traditionally been pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, offering stability and liquidity in a somewhat volatile ecosystem. Now, the landscape of stablecoins is evolving, with innovative projects emerging that look beyond conventional USD pegs. These new stablecoins are tethered to alternative assets like commodities, real estate, or even diversified baskets of cryptocurrencies, introducing a fresh perspective on stability and risk management within the digital asset domain. While USD-pegged stablecoins like tether (USDT) and USDC dominate the market, they are subject to the fluctuations and vulnerabilities of the U.S. dollar. In contrast, stablecoins tied to alternative assets offer diversification benefits and reduced exposure to currency risk. Commodity-backed stablecoins, for example, are pegged to the value of underlying commodities such as gold, silver, or oil, providing intrinsic value and hedging against inflationary pressures.

Real estate-backed stablecoins leverage the stability and appreciation potential of tangible assets, allowing investors to access fractional ownership in properties worldwide. These stablecoins are backed by real estate portfolios, offering liquidity and diversification in an asset class traditionally characterized by illiquidity and high barriers to entry. Another groundbreaking approach is stablecoins tied to a basket of cryptocurrencies, like DAI and wrapped bitcoin, offer stability while capturing the potential upside of the digital asset market. These diversified stablecoins mitigate single-currency risk and provide exposure to a broader spectrum of cryptocurrencies, reducing volatility and enhancing portfolio resilience. The emergence of stablecoins beyond USD pegs reflects a maturing market and growing investor demand for stability, transparency, and diversification in digital assets. These alternative stablecoins offer a compelling value proposition for investors seeking to preserve capital and navigate the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape with confidence. In emerging markets, for example, with unstable local currencies, stablecoins provide a reliable alternative to traditional dollars, facilitating cross-border transactions and financial inclusion. Not all stablecoins, however, deliver on their promise of stability and liquidity. In mid-2022, TerraUSD was de-pegged, losing its value, simultaneously crashing the price of its sister coin, Luna. In a matter of days, both coins quickly became worthless, wiping billions of dollars off the cryptocurrency markets. Despite their potential benefits, alternative stablecoins face regulatory scrutiny, liquidity challenges, and valuation complexities. Regulatory frameworks governing commodity-backed stablecoins and real estate-backed stablecoins vary across jurisdictions, requiring robust compliance measures and legal frameworks to ensure investor protection and compliance. Moreover, the liquidity of alternative stablecoins may be limited compared to USD-pegged stablecoins, posing challenges for trading and market adoption. Valuation methodologies for alternative assets can also be complex and opaque, requiring transparency and independent audits to instill investor trust and confidence. In conclusion, stablecoin innovations beyond USD pegs represent a significant paradigm shift in the cryptocurrency market, offering investors new avenues for stability, diversification, and risk management. While challenges remain, the growing adoption and maturation of alternative stablecoins signal a transformative shift toward a more resilient and inclusive digital asset ecosystem.

In the run-up, implied volatility (IV) on the largest cryptocurrency by market value has ticked higher, suggesting increased price turbulence in the days surrounding the quadrennial event. Still, one observer does not favor placing bullish bets on volatility. "From a qualitative perspective, I continue to believe paying a volatility premium for a highly predictable outcome (the BTC halving) isn't worth a volatility event premium," Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in a newsletter on Monday. Traders typically place bullish bets on volatility ahead of binary events, for which the market outcome is uncertain. Moreover, uncertainty opens the door to pre- and post-event price turbulence and has traders buying both call and put options or volatility futures to profit from any price swings. But the impact of Bitcoin's reward halving on its native cryptocurrency and miners has been well documented. The cryptocurrency has historically produced stellar rallies in the 12-18 months following the halving. Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained It's important to note that major crypto events like Ethereum's Dencun upgrade, Shanghai upgrade, and spot BTC listings turned out to have little market impact, disappointing traders positioned for an event-led surge in price volatility. "Not to mention that nearly all the big volatility events in crypto (ETH PoS merge, ETH Shanghai upgrade, BTC spot ETF decision) had disappointed IV [implied volatility], buyers when RV [realized volatility] failed to materialize by very large margins," Magadini noted. Bitcoin's 30-day implied volatility, which gauges the expected price turbulence over four weeks, has increased to an annualized 75% from 68% in a week, according to Amberdata. Meanwhile, the 30-day volatility risk premium (VRP), or the gap between 30-day implied and realized volatilities, has surpassed 10% for the first time since early March. The VRP tends to rise ahead of and following extraordinary market events and can drop to low levels during extended periods of calm markets. "Options implied volatility is overpricing the event," Magadini said, noting the uptick in VRP. Bitcoin changed hands at $71,800 at press time, representing a 3.5% gain on the day. The cryptocurrency has risen over 11% since hitting lows near $64,500 on April 2, CoinDesk data show. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the broader crypto market, had added 3.8% over 24 hours.

The ETCs, which carry the Frankfurt-based company's Xtrackers branding, were developed in conjunction with digital asset financial services firm Galaxy Digital (GLXY). They were listed on the Deutsche Boerse on Thursday, according to a DWS statement. The products, the Xtrackers Galaxy Physical Bitcoin ETC and Xtrackers Galaxy Physical Ethereum ETC, track the performance of the two largest cryptocurrencies by market value and carry a fee of 0.35%.

The U.S. funds have attracted a net inflow of about $12 billion in less than three months, according to BitMEX Research. DWS, which has 896 billion euros ($970 billion) under management, and Galaxy Digital teamed up a year ago to develop exchange-traded products (ETPs) for listing in Europe.

Gold has outperformed, and this may benefit bitcoin (BTC), Coinbase (COIN) said in a research report on Friday. “Given the market’s recent hawkish views on rate cuts, we think gold’s performance signals an overweighting on inflation relative to Fed rate changes as well as an overall belief that certain inflation bumps could materialize more problematically than anticipated,” the report said. “Bitcoin’s increased acceptance as a form of ‘digital gold’ could enable demand from a new subset of investors in this regime,” wrote analyst David Han. “As a result, we think dips are likely to be more aggressively bought compared to previous cycles, even as volatility persists during price discovery.” Among other macroeconomic signals that inflation may not be entirely subdued, the U.S. jobs market continues to surprise to the upside. The economy added 303,000 jobs last month, the government said Friday. That's the strongest headline number since last May and it beat economist forecasts of 200,000 and February’s 270,000 additions. The cryptocurrency’s wider access to capital following the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. could result in less volatility, according to the report. The capital unlocked by spot ETFs “perhaps represents the most fundamental shift in market structure between the previous 2020-21 cycle and today,” Coinbase said. This capital injection, coupled with the bitcoin halving coming later this month and other positive catalysts, makes Coinbase still largely positive on its outlook for crypto markets for the second quarter. The quadrennial halving is when miner rewards are slashed by 50%, thereby reducing the rate of growth in the supply of bitcoin. The next halving is expected to occur around April 20.

That's the strongest headline number since May 2023 and easily topped economist forecasts for 200,000 and February's 270,000 additions (revised from a previously reported 275,000). The unemployment rate in March dipped to 3.8% against expectations for 3.9% and February's 3.9%. The price of bitcoin (BTC) fell about 0.5% in the minutes following Friday morning's report to $66,000. In traditional markets, U.S. stock index futures gave up a chunk of earlier gains, but are still modestly higher. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose 6.5 basis points to 4.38% and the dollar index added 0.5%. Coming into 2024, markets had priced in as many as five or six U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts to begin as soon as March. The economic data, however, hasn't cooperated. Inflation has actually risen somewhat in the first quarter of the year and job growth has remained robust. March has obviously come and gone with no rate cut and traders ahead of today's numbers had moved expectations of the first rate cut to June or July, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. A total of just three rate cuts are expected for the full year and even that could be too much. Speaking yesterday, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari suggested the possibility of no rate cuts at all in 2024. His remarks prompted a sharp reversal in stocks, with the major averages closing down more than 1%. Just following today's numbers, swaps trading indicated expectations for the first rate cut had moved out to September. Checking other report details, the labor force participation rate rose to 62.7% from 62.5%, suggesting sizable numbers of people returning to the workforce. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in March, in line with expectations and up from 0.2% in February. On a year-over-year basis, average hourly earnings rose an in line 4.1%, down from 4.3% in February.

The options market shows investors are taking the hint. A death cross occurs when a short-term moving average drops below the long-term moving average, signaling a potential long-term bearish shift in momentum. The ratio's 50-week simple moving average (SMA) appears on track to cross below the 200-week SMA, according to charting platform TradingView. The impending death cross signals risk aversion or prolonged underperformance of ether (ETH) and other altcoins relative to bitcoin (BTC). Since 2017, the crypto market has oscillated between bitcoin-led regimes and altcoin-led regimes. More importantly, altcoin leadership has been characterized by a rising ETH/BTC ratio. In other words, traders are willing to take more risk when ether is outperforming bitcoin and vice versa. The ETH/BTC ratio has dropped nearly 10% to 0.048 this year, TradingView data show . "The ETHBTC cross is testing a critical support level after breaking below 0.05," Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a market note Friday. "There has been a persistent large selling of ETH calls which has crushed [volatility] and also put some downside pressure on price. Could this again be a very early signal of [bullish] FOMO turning into fear in ETH as a proxy for alts." The way bitcoin and ether options are currently priced on Deribit, the leading derivatives exchange, also points to expectations for ether underperformance in the near term. At press time, ether puts expiring in seven days, one and two months traded at premiums of 5%, 3% and 0.3%, respectively, to calls. A put option gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call option gives the right to buy, so the premium for puts – which provide protection against a price decline – indicates a bearish outlook. In bitcoin's case, the bias was for calls across maturities, excluding seven-day options. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

16::https://cryptobriefing.com/genesis-creditor-payout-approval/::Crypto Briefing::article::Genesis wins court nod to return $3 billion to creditors::Given the overwhelming debt and large creditor claims, there's no chance of anything being left for equity holders like DCG.::Share this article Bankrupt crypto lending company Genesis Global Holdco received court permission to return approximately $3 billion in cash and crypto assets to its creditors as part of its bankruptcy liquidation process on Friday. US Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane made the decision. In addition, Judge Sean Lane rejected Digital Currency Group’s (DCG), attempt to challenge the distribution plan for the debtors’ assets in the bankruptcy case. DCG objected to the distribution plan as it believes repayments should be capped at the crypto asset values of January 2023 (at the time of Genesis’ bankruptcy filing). Since then, the value of cryptos like Bitcoin has surged, with Bitcoin’s price jumping from around $21,000 to a current value of nearly $67,000. The firm also claimed that the plan provides too much return to creditors at DCG’s expense. Essentially, DCG feels that it is unfairly disadvantaged by how the returns are allocated. However, DCG’s arguments failed. Judge Sean Lane ruled that, as an equity holder, DCG’s financial interest isn’t directly impacted by how the assets are distributed. Equity holders only get paid after all creditors are satisfied. Additionally, given the insolvency and the massive creditor claims, DCG won’t receive any distribution under this plan. The total amount owed to creditors is billions of dollars higher than the debtors’ available assets. These claims have priority over equity holders like DCG, meaning they get paid first in line during bankruptcy. The ruling also considered the substantial $32 billion in claims from federal and state financial regulators, prioritizing them over DCG’s equity stake. Genesis had previously estimated that it could pay up to 77% of the value of customer claims, a figure subject to future market fluctuations. Hit hard by the collapse of Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and FTX, Genesis – along with other lending platforms – faced liquidity issues during the 2022 market downturn. This ultimately led the company to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2023. Genesis’ creditors include several prominent names, such as Gemini, Bybit’s Mirama, Decentraland, and VanEck. Adding to its troubles, Genesis Global Capital faced a legal lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC accused Genesis and Gemini of selling unregistered securities through Gemini Earn. The company reached a $21 million settlement with the SEC in March this year.
