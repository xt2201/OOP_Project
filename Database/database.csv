Early Monday; BTC rose past $72;000; passing through a triangular consolidation pattern identified by a resistance line connecting March 15 and March 27 highs and a support line connecting March 20 and April 3 lows. ""If the breakout is bullish; which we suspect; bitcoin could climb above 80;000 during the next few weeks – if not earlier. Buying at $69;280 and setting a stop loss at $65;000 appears appropriate;"" Markus Thielen; founder of 10X Research; said in a note sent to clients early Monday. The upside target of $80;000 equates to at least a 10% rise from the current price of $72;300. The breakout comes on the heels of a hotter-than-expected nonfarm payrolls report that highlighted the U.S. economic resilience; spurring risk-taking across all corners of the financial market. Bitcoin has been riding what can be described as an ""everything rally"" this year. Not only has the cryptocurrency soared to new highs; but so have traditional assets like Wall Street's tech-heavy index; Nasdaq; the broader S&P 500 and gold. The cryptocurrency's rally has been supported by persistent expansion in the supply of major stablecoins. In technical analysis; investors and analysts study price patterns to predict future trends in the asset. A symmetrical triangle; often called a coil; represents consolidation within a narrowing price range. The market typically builds energy during the consolidation; which is eventually unleashed in the direction in which the range is resolved. More often than not; symmetrical triangles end with a bullish breakout. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

The SEC accused Terraform Labs and Kwon of misleading investors about the stability of its so-called “algorithmic” native stablecoin; Terra USD (UST); and the use cases for the Terra blockchain. The jury delivered the verdict on Friday; just two hours after lawyers for both the SEC and the defendants gave their closing arguments at the end of the nine-day trial in New York. Jurors agreed with the SEC that Kwon and; under his direction; Terraform Labs deceived everyday investors about the nature of the supposed algorithm that kept UST pegged to the U.S. dollar. Though Kwon insinuated that it could “automatically self-heal” in the event of a de-peg; it actually relied on continuous trading activity; including large-scale trading done by institutional investors. “We are pleased with today’s jury verdict holding Terraform Labs and Do Kwon liable for a massive crypto fraud;” Gurbir Grewal; SEC Division of Enforcement director; wrote in a statement. “The defendants caused devastating losses for investors and wiped out tens of billions of market value nearly overnight. For all of crypto’s promises; the lack of registration and compliance have very real consequences for real people. As the hard work of our team shows; we will continue to use the tools at our disposal to protect the investing public; but it is high time for the crypto markets to come into compliance;” Grewal added. SEC attorney Laura Meehan told the jury during her closing arguments on Friday that one of those institutional investors – Jump Trading – had made a secret deal with Kwon and Terraform Labs to rescue UST during a de-pegging event in May 2021; stepping in and buying millions of dollars of UST off-chain to reinflate its value and bring it back to parity with the dollar. Meehan added that; after Jump’s intervention; Kwon and his company intentionally kept the firm’s rescue mission quiet; wanting instead to use the re-pegging as evidence of the algorithm’s effectiveness. Lawyers for Terraform Labs and Kwon attempted to wave Jump’s involvement away as a regular part of their relationship with Terraform Labs as a market maker. They said that all “reasonable” investors knew that the algorithm that kept UST pegged to the dollar was not a “magical machine” or “computer that functioned on its own” but instead; minting and burning done by market participants. The jury; as evidenced by their verdict; did not agree. A spokesperson for Terraform Labs told CoinDesk: “We are very disappointed with the verdict; which we do not believe is supported by the evidence. We continue to maintain that the SEC does not have the legal authority to bring this case at all; and we are carefully weighing our options and next steps.” Kwon was not in Manhattan for his civil trial; instead; he was stuck in Montenegro; where he had been since his arrest in March 2023. Kwon was caught en route to Dubai attempting to use fake Costa Rican travel documents after months on the run. Kwon also faces criminal charges in the U.S. and his native South Korea; which are tied to the implosion of the Terra ecosystem. Both countries are currently vying for his extradition; but his final destination remains unclear as Montenegro's Supreme Court weighs the competing requests. UPDATE (19:10 UTC April 5): The story was updated to include a comment from a Terraform Labs spokesperson.

2,https://www.coindesk.com/sponsored-content/influencer-achieves-significant-growth-through-inscriptions-on-phemex/,CoinDesk,article,Influencer Achieves Significant Growth Through Inscriptions on Phemex,,Sponsored Content Phemex; a leading digital asset exchange; recognizes the pivotal role that platforms play as trusted partners in nurturing crypto communities. That’s why it has a detailed plan to ensure its traders are united and empowered. The team behind Phemex has recently rolled out its new social trading feature; PhemexPulse; and it swiftly grabbed the crypto space’s attention. Intrinsically linked to the Web3 ecosystem; PhemexPulse offers a lucrative daily earning scheme that turns your routine social interactions into crypto rewards. However; the appeal of PhemexPulse extends beyond its rewards scheme; giving back to users for their engagement. The platform also features a unique inscription marketplace; where key opinion leaders (KOLs) can release exclusive inscriptions for their followers to mint; collect and trade. Ben Armstrong; a prominent figure in the crypto world; was the first to introduce his inscriptions on PhemexPulse; which led to an impressive surge in value of over 7;296% within the initial post-launch hours. This momentum was sustained over the next five days; culminating in a new all-time high (ATH) on March 20; representing a 56% increase from its initial peak. This remarkable growth translated into a cumulative 11;400% gain for the asset holders. In just one week's time; a user who started by minting 10 inscriptions; earning them 10 PT on day one; has experienced a staggering growth; with their holdings skyrocketing to 1000 PT. “Ben has long been a pivotal influencer within the crypto sphere; offering seasoned advice to crypto enthusiasts;” says Phemex COO Stella Chan. “His decision to release his inscriptions on PhemexPulse was met with enthusiasm; as the community eagerly seized the opportunity to acquire them.” Before we get too far ahead of ourselves; though; let’s assume not everyone knows what inscriptions – and their related assets; ordinals – are. They’ve only been around for about a year. They’re basically NFTs predicated on bitcoin. Ordinals are a system for ordering sats – that is; bitcoin fractions – in a way that renders them non-fungible. Inscriptions; then; are the contents of the ordinal NFT. They can be images; videos; texts or any other data. On PhemexPulse; KOLs act as content creators and can also launch their distinct ordinals through an inscription marketplace; allowing the community’s aggregate demand to determine the value of each. Supporters vote with their wallets by acquiring these inscriptions to engage with and back their preferred influencers on PhemexPulse. Recently; Armstrong – who has 100;000 YouTube followers – introduced his exclusive inscriptions on PhemexPulse; limiting ownership to just 600 enthusiasts; with no more than 10 inscriptions per person. Scarcity tends to drive up prices; so the market met this release with an immediate surge. “Ben’s inscriptions are a testament to the explosive potential in this space;” according to Chan. “At Phemex; we're not just strengthening community ties by facilitating deeper connections with leading crypto figures; but also providing a gateway to a vibrant market.” KOLs including Armstrong can nest pretty much any kind of data they want in these NFTs. Some might be collectible in their own right with no intrinsic value beyond the influencer’s fandom – but they might still be fun and lucrative to acquire. Others; though; could conceivably contain investment tips; instructions to access insider-only coin drops or other opportunities to earn. And there’s a potential early-adopter benefit to acquiring inscriptions before anyone else has even heard of them. The value of inscriptions on PhemexPulse are measured in PT; Phemex’s native coin. While Armstrong deserves credit for paving the way; the inscription market has a lot of growth potential for other influencers looking to get in on the ground floor. KOLs can monetize their influence on PhemexPulse simply by creating their own Web3 group; funded by Phemex. By attracting followers with top-notch content and trading tips; these influencers and their followers can unlock daily PT rewards based on their accumulated points. Indeed; the landscape is crowded with various social networking platforms that users frequent; particularly during a bull market. However; PhemexPulse distinguishes itself by not only rewarding users for their consistent online engagement; but also by fostering a closer relationship between KOLs and their followers within a conversational environment. It has already cultivated a dynamic marketplace where unique creations can be minted; held and valued. Phemex is now inviting more content creators to join PhemexPulse and establish their own groups; capitalizing on the myriad opportunities that both they and the market offer. For more information; to join a PhemexPulse group or to create your own using; visit its website.

4,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/05/did-strong-bitcoin-etf-demand-kill-halvings-potential-bullish-rally/,CoinDesk,article,Did Strong Bitcoin ETF Demand Kill Halving's Potential Bullish Rally?,The much stronger-than-expected inflows into the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have already caused concerns about a supply shock in the bitcoin market; potentially taking away some of the impacts of the halving.,"Bitcoin's (BTC) halving - which is often seen as a bullish catalyst for the price - may not be as positive as the market thinks; thanks to the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETF). Halving; which occurs every four years; cuts bitcoin's supply growth by half; historically causing upward pressure on the price of the largest digital asset. The previous halving cycles pushed bitcoin to new highs; and this time; strong demand from the spot ETF may add even more fuel to the rally. “If we look at demand generally since the ETFs have launched; it has created tremendous supply shock already;” said Brian Dixon; CEO of investment firm Off the Chain Capital. “Once the halving occurs; and that supply is further reduced; it's only logical to think that the price will appreciate.” Read more: Bitcoin Halving; Explained On the surface; that may be the case as the demand from the funds has been significantly more than the 900 new BTC that are mined daily. And when that supply gets cut in half; it might create an even bigger pull on the prices. However; it might not play out the same way this time. The price of bitcoin had rallied 46% since Jan. 11; when the spot ETFs started trading in the U.S. The demand from these funds has been so strong that the price of the digital asset rallied to a new all-time high to keep up with the onslaught of bitcoin purchases. But the market may have gotten a bit ahead of itself in the hype. “This is the first time in which bitcoin broke its all-time highs before the halving; so there is a little bit of a concern that the ETFs have pulled demand forward and that maybe we're going to linger where we are for a little bit;"" said David Lawant; Head of Research at FalconX. Anthony Anderson; founder and CEO of Param Labs and Kiraverse; echoed this sentiment. ""Bitcoin ETFs preempted the impact of halving on supply by massively acquiring BTC since the beginning of the year."" Also; halving might not affect the ETF flows either due to the already strong demand from the investors; at least not in the short term; according to Bloomberg Intelligence's ETF analyst James Seyffart. Read More: Bitcoin Could Slump Around Reward Halving Time; Arthur Hayes Says ""We know many miners use OTC desks to offload their BTC and the ETF issuers also use OTC desks to obtain their Bitcoin as flows come into the fund. So theoretically the potential halving of miner bitcoin sales could mean that ETF inflows will have a greater impact on the underlying market. But for the last few months the ETF inflows have vastly exceeded anything the miners provided from operations;"" he said. ""So if it does have an impact it’s unlikely to be anything extremely impactful in my view;"" Seyffart added. This is not to say that halving won't be a significant catalyst for bitcoin and the ETF flows in the long term. After all; the success of the ETFs seems to be closely correlated to the price of BTC and vice versa. The halving may even accentuate the appeal of bitcoin as an asset class to institutional investors. “I think the halving is going to be one of the best things for bitcoin since the ETFs launched;” said Bob Iacchino; co-founder of analytics firm Path Trading Partners. “At its core is an inflation protection mechanism and inflation is ramping back up.” In fact; the hype around halving might help bitcoin bring it in front of many investors looking for alternative assets to hedge against the global macro volatility. ""This [Halving] is happening at a time when folks are somewhat queasy about the risk that Bitcoin hedges against;"" said Lawant; pointing out that many investors are starting to pay more attention to how to protect their portfolio against any significant change in global economy and having spot ETF and an asset class with shrinking supply ""would be positive for ETF flows."" This supply shortage might also lead to a longer-term impact on the ETF flows as it will impact bitcoin's ""marginal supply into perpetuity;"" said Seyffart. He added that; even though the impact of the marginal supply from ETF inflows in the first three months has been much higher than the halving can have; the slashing of the supply of BTC is ""permanent and goes into perpetuity."" Whatever the case may be; the market may need to brace for volatile short-term trading for bitcoin and perhaps for the ETF flow after the halving; said Anderson; noting that in the long term; net flows for the funds should come in at a similar pace that is seen currently.

The new APs include Wall Street banking giants Goldman Sachs; Citadel Securities; Citigroup and UBS as well as clearing house ABN AMRO; according to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They join Jane Street Capital; JP Morgan; Masquarie and Virtu Americas. CoinDesk reported in January that Goldman Sachs was looking to play a key role for the bitcoin ETFs and was in talks with issuers about becoming an AP. APs are an integral part of the ETF process as they help create liquidity by changing the supply of shares when there’s a shortage or a surplus. Large ETFs typically have dozens of APs; and in less than three months of existence; IBIT has become fairly sizable with nearly $18 billion in assets under management as of the close yesterday. The participation of Goldman Sachs is particularly notable as its wealth management chief investment officer just this week said the bank believes that crypto has ""no value"" and feels no pressure to participate in the space even as other TradFi giants are taking major steps.

The quadrennial halving is when miner rewards are reduced; slowing the rate of growth in bitcoin supply. Benchmark raised its MicroStrategy price target to $1;875 from $990 while maintaining its buy rating. The new price target is based on the assumption that bitcoin will reach $150;000 by the end of 2025; up from $125;000 previously. MicroStrategy shares rose more than 11% to around $1;601 in trading before the official open of U.S. markets. “While the upcoming bitcoin halving will create a supply shock as the previous ones had; we believe the event’s impact could be magnified by the concurrent demand shock created by the emergence of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs);” Palmer wrote; adding that “we expect inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs to grow dramatically once institutions begin to invest in them in earnest.” MicroStrategy has a unique business model based on the acquisition and holding of bitcoin. The company is expected to continue to add to its bitcoin stash using proceeds from capital markets transactions and excess cash generated by its enterprise software business; the report said. Benchmark estimates that the company will hold 298;246 bitcoins by year-end 2025; up from the 214;246 coins it owned as of March 19. Rival broker BTIG said the software developer’s implied premium to bitcoin is supported by investors who want exposure to digital assets but may be unable to invest directly in the cryptocurrency or ETFs; and also supported by the company’s ability to accretively raise capital to purchase additional BTC; it wrote in a report on Friday.

U.S. crypto-related stocks looked set to start the week on a positive note after bitcoin (BTC) climbed through $72;000 for the first time since mid-March as its reward halving draws closer. Coinbase (COIN); the only U.S. traded crypto exchange; gained 4.9% in pre-market trading; MicroStrategy (MSTR); the largest corporate holder of bitcoin; rose 10% and BlackRock’s bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT); added around 6.5%. Bitcoin advanced 4.4% over 24 hours while the CoinDesk 20 Index; a measure of the broader crypto market; rose 4.1%. Other tokens rising on Monday included meme coins dogwifhat; which gained 18%; and pepe; which rose 10%. According to trader Michaël van de Poppe; there is still a lot of momentum to be gained for altcoins as bitcoin dominance continues to peak pre-halving. “They [altcoins] are super undervalued;” van de Poppe said in a post on X. Bitcoin could soon rally to new record highs after breaking through a so-called triangle resistance; according to technical analysis by 10x Research. On its way to $72;000; BTC passed through a triangular consolidation pattern identified by a resistance line connecting March 15 and March 27 highs and a support line connecting March 20 and April 3 lows. ""If the breakout is bullish; which we suspect; bitcoin could climb above 80;000 during the next few weeks – if not earlier. Buying at $69;280 and setting a stop loss at $65;000 appears appropriate;"" Markus Thielen; founder of 10X Research; said in a note sent to clients early Monday. BlackRock (BLK) added five authorized participants (APs) to the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT); bringing the total number to nine as the exchange-traded fund continues to attract billions of dollars from investors. The new APs include Wall Street banking giants Goldman Sachs; Citadel Securities; Citigroup and UBS alongside clearing house ABN AMRO; according to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They join Jane Street Capital; JPMorgan; Masquarie and Virtu Americas. CoinDesk reported in January that Goldman Sachs was looking to play a key role for the bitcoin ETFs and was in talks with issuers about becoming an AP.

The “TOKEN Supercharge Program” will provide preferential treatment for TOKEN holders and stakers; allowing them to secure tokens ahead of the broader public if the proposal passes. The proposed move would further allow eligible users to acquire up to four times more tokens than the standard quota per wallet. Users who do not stake or hold TOKEN may face limited access to token sale events. Users must stake or hold a minimum of $1;000 worth of $TOKEN for the proposed priority access; with higher holdings offering additional advantages. “We have close to a dozen of these token launches already planned and due to be announced in the coming days and weeks;” TokenFi developer B told CoinDesk in a release. “However; we envision a scenario in which some of these token sale events could be sold out in minutes; especially if open to the general public.” This could result in the majority of $TOKEN stakers and holders being unable to participate in these events when they should be the main beneficiaries;” he added. TokenFi; which uses token (TOKEN) as its native digital asset; lets users launch any cryptocurrency without writing code. It was started in 2023 as a sister project to Floki; a former dog-themed meme coin that has since pivoted into a metaverse and decentralized finance platform. At the time of writing; TOKEN prices were little changed; trading at 16 cents; data shows. Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

9,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/03/13/why-prime-brokers-could-be-a-source-of-crypto-contagion/,CoinDesk,article,Why Prime Brokers Could Be a Source of Crypto Contagion,Prime brokers are a new source of liquidity in this cycle; which could be good and bad in the long-run; says Phillip Moran; CEO of the Digital Opportunities Group.,Digital asset markets have been vibrant recently; and this has been a great respite after almost two years of crypto winter. I do not want to throw a wet towel on current sentiment; but it is good to remember that the seeds of the next crash are often sown during the good times. Because risk management is the primary job of all portfolio managers; here I want to opine on one potential scenario if this bull market continues for another 18-plus months. Here is why I think the potential nexus for future contagion could be prime brokers (PBs). Why? Because 1) PBs are emerging as a major player and lender in crypto markets and2) The current lending standards of PBs are tight; largely lending to low drawdown strategies (like delta-neutral); and presents low systemic risk. But; 3); if expected returns of delta-neutral strategies decline; then PBs may move out the risk curve in terms of who they are willing to lend to and what services they offer; which could brew systemic risk. During the last bullish cycle; lenders increased the violence of the implosions that we witnessed. Leverage was hidden across a network of entities (BlockFi; Voyager; etc.); with concentration at certain nodes (3AC; Alameda). The lenders of the old-world are largely gone; but there is a new source of liquidity: prime brokers (PBs). Currently; PBs generate most of their revenues through 1) trading revenues from market access; and 2) lending revenues from lending; typically to delta-neutral strategies. Funding arbitrage is a strategy which benefits from market demand to go long via derivatives. This exploits the funding interest rates paid out from perpetual swaps (a crypto derivative product) by going long on spot and short perpetual swaps (or vice versa). This generates attractive yields and exploits market demand to go levered long; while not exposing the strategy to directional market moves. If the strategy is implemented well; the risk is very low; which makes it a popular strategy for PBs to lend to. While funding rates are currently elevated from recent upside price action; I believe it is reasonable to expect the returns to come down as more money flows into these lower-risk strategies. With returns declining in funding arbitrage; we will likely see returns in other lower risk strategies fall. If expected returns decline below the borrow cost from PB loans; then the PBs will be forced to make the decision to move out the risk spectrum or reconsider their product offerings. What could this apocalyptic future fueled by crypto PB collapse look like? What could it be fueled by? Here are a couple ideas: Further aggregation of liquidity through PBs: Increasing volume requirements for better fee tiers at centralized exchanges; like Binance and OKX; will push most traders to access the market through PBs instead of their own master accounts. Synthetics; swaps; other derivatives: If trading directly on exchange becomes restricted (either due to the exchanges themselves limiting direct access; or the PBs limiting access); this may create a market of derivatives for traders where the PB will clear the other side (usually this is a swap mechanism). This opens the door for accounting issues; or leverage shenanigans. We should enjoy the good times while they are here; while also considering future disaster scenarios. Stay safe out there; everyone. Edited by Benjamin Schiller. Disclosure Please note that our privacy policy; terms of use; cookies; and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

10,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/02/14/how-the-halving-could-impact-bitcoin/,CoinDesk,article,How the ‘Halving’ Could Impact Bitcoin,Bitcoin halvings have generally been good for the network. But price increases have decreased over time; says Todd Groth; head of research at CoinDesk Indices.,The new entrants coming into Bitcoin via the recently launched ETF and prices bounce back up towards $50;000; it’s a good time to dig a bit into the Bitcoin halving; as we’re expected to go into another halving event in mid-April. The Bitcoin halving cycle refers to the recurring event that reduces the blockchain rewards paid in bitcoin and given to miners for validating transactions and creating new blocks on the blockchain. This reduction occurs approximately every four years; specifically when the number of total blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain reaches a certain threshold; currently set at 210;000 blocks. You're reading Crypto Long & Short; our weekly newsletter featuring insights; news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. The halving event aims to maintain the scarcity of Bitcoin by gradually decreasing the rate at which new Bitcoins are introduced into circulation. Ultimately; this process will result in a total of 21 million Bitcoins being mined; with no more Bitcoins being generated after the final halving event. Read more: What Is the Bitcoin Halving? The general consensus is that Bitcoin halving events are positive for the price of Bitcoin; and historically they have been. The event often generates optimism among crypto investors; leading to positive price action afterward. This positive price movement can be attributed to several factors. Firstly; the reduction in the supply issuance rate emphasizes Bitcoin's scarcity; which can drive up demand and consequently increase its price. Additionally; the halving event brings attention to the crypto space; attracting new investors and contributing to increased trading activity. However; it's important to note that while the halving historically has led to price increases; the magnitude of these increases may diminish with each subsequent halvings. To look more closely into the effects Bitcoin halving periods have had on distribution of returns; we looked back from July 2010 to February 2024 utilizing the CoinDesk Indices Bitcoin XBX Price Index; and compare the distribution of weekly returns of each halving period as bitcoin increased in value from 0.1 to recent levels of 50k USD per BTC. (Source: CoinDesk Indices; Investing.com) July 2010 - October 2014 period utilizes BTCUSD pricing from Investing.com; Return outliers of 0.5% and 99.5% were removed for sake of distribution illustrative purposes. (Source: CoinDesk Indices; Investing.com) From the overlay of these distributions; and comparison of annual return and volatility; we can see that as the distribution of returns has narrowed as the bitcoin market has matured from a crypto enthusiast hobby to a real asset with institutional interest. This evolution can also be seen in the decrease in both returns and volatility over each subsequent halving; while Return per Volatility has held more constant after the first halving. This evolution suggests that investors should not expect similar performance gains in Bitcoin that were experienced when the market was in its early stages prior to 2012. One area of the market that is directly affected by the halving event is the Bitcoin miners; via an immediate halving of block rewards for new blocks. This reduction in mining rewards can impact miners' revenue and profitability; as miners could face increased competition and higher operational costs; potentially leading to consolidation within the mining sector. Smaller miners may struggle to remain profitable; while larger players with greater resources; cheaper sources of electricity and economies of scale may dominate the industry. Looking beyond the halving events; the future of Bitcoin mining will eventually transition to relying solely on transaction fees once all 21 million Bitcoins have been mined. This shift will occur approximately 31 years after Bitcoin's inception. Miners will need to adapt to this change towards relying solely on transaction fees; although this will be a gradual change from each halving. Innovations in the crypto space; such as additional protocols and tokens that coexist alongside Bitcoin (e.g. Ordinals); may provide opportunities for miners to diversify and optimize their mining operations to maintain revenue beyond Bitcoin block rewards. We’ve come a long way in the evolution of Bitcoin from a cypherpunk and cryptography enthusiast hobby to a digitally-scarce store of value with its own spot ETFs and regulated derivative markets. That said; through market cycles; and increases in market capitalization; the volatility of the asset has decreased. So we should taper our expectations when analyzing historical halving cycles; as Bitcoin holders today are very different from holders in 2010. Edited by Benjamin Schiller.

11,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/02/07/diversifying-stability-stablecoins-finding-home-beyond-the-greenback/,CoinDesk,article,Diversifying Stability: Stablecoins Finding Home Beyond the Greenback,Following the success of Tether and USDC; a generation of stablecoins are offering new features for investors and holders; says Scott Sunshine; Managing Partner of Blue Dot Advisors.,Stablecoins; the backbone of the cryptocurrency market; with their $135 billion market cap; have traditionally been pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar; offering stability and liquidity in a somewhat volatile ecosystem. Now; the landscape of stablecoins is evolving; with innovative projects emerging that look beyond conventional USD pegs. These new stablecoins are tethered to alternative assets like commodities; real estate; or even diversified baskets of cryptocurrencies; introducing a fresh perspective on stability and risk management within the digital asset domain. While USD-pegged stablecoins like tether (USDT) and USDC dominate the market; they are subject to the fluctuations and vulnerabilities of the U.S. dollar. In contrast; stablecoins tied to alternative assets offer diversification benefits and reduced exposure to currency risk. Commodity-backed stablecoins; for example; are pegged to the value of underlying commodities such as gold; silver; or oil; providing intrinsic value and hedging against inflationary pressures. You're reading Crypto Long & Short; our weekly newsletter featuring insights; news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Real estate-backed stablecoins leverage the stability and appreciation potential of tangible assets; allowing investors to access fractional ownership in properties worldwide. These stablecoins are backed by real estate portfolios; offering liquidity and diversification in an asset class traditionally characterized by illiquidity and high barriers to entry. Another groundbreaking approach is stablecoins tied to a basket of cryptocurrencies; like DAI and wrapped bitcoin; offer stability while capturing the potential upside of the digital asset market. These diversified stablecoins mitigate single-currency risk and provide exposure to a broader spectrum of cryptocurrencies; reducing volatility and enhancing portfolio resilience. The emergence of stablecoins beyond USD pegs reflects a maturing market and growing investor demand for stability; transparency; and diversification in digital assets. These alternative stablecoins offer a compelling value proposition for investors seeking to preserve capital and navigate the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape with confidence. In emerging markets; for example; with unstable local currencies; stablecoins provide a reliable alternative to traditional dollars; facilitating cross-border transactions and financial inclusion. Not all stablecoins; however; deliver on their promise of stability and liquidity. In mid-2022; TerraUSD was de-pegged; losing its value; simultaneously crashing the price of its sister coin; Luna. In a matter of days; both coins quickly became worthless; wiping billions of dollars off the cryptocurrency markets. Despite their potential benefits; alternative stablecoins face regulatory scrutiny; liquidity challenges; and valuation complexities. Regulatory frameworks governing commodity-backed stablecoins and real estate-backed stablecoins vary across jurisdictions; requiring robust compliance measures and legal frameworks to ensure investor protection and compliance. Moreover; the liquidity of alternative stablecoins may be limited compared to USD-pegged stablecoins; posing challenges for trading and market adoption. Valuation methodologies for alternative assets can also be complex and opaque; requiring transparency and independent audits to instill investor trust and confidence. In conclusion; stablecoin innovations beyond USD pegs represent a significant paradigm shift in the cryptocurrency market; offering investors new avenues for stability; diversification; and risk management. While challenges remain; the growing adoption and maturation of alternative stablecoins signal a transformative shift toward a more resilient and inclusive digital asset ecosystem.

BTC rose 2% in the past 24 hours taking it to the highest since April 1; data from CoinGecko shows. The broad-based CoinDesk 20; an index of the most liquid tokens excluding stablecoins; was up 0.43%. When halving occurs; the reward for mining transactions is cut by 50%; reducing the rate at which new coins are created and thus lowering the available new supply. This has historically preceded a bull market for the token. The current block reward is 6.25 BTC; and will drop to 3.125 BTC after the halving. Open interest on BTC-tracked futures has maintained record-high levels at above $25 billion for a few weeks; indicative of leveraged bets on more expected price volatility. Some Bitcoin ecosystem tokens and projects rose as traders expect a BTC rally following the halving event. Such bets are a way to gain proxy exposure to bitcoin's rise without using futures products or leverage. Data shows Ordinals volumes were higher than those of usual leaders Ethereum and Solana in the past week; led by NodeMonkes and Pups. Non-fungible token (NFT) buying and selling activity declined 95% across all networks in the same period; suggestive of an isolated rise in Ordinals. The BRC-20 category of tokens gained nearly 6% in the past 24 hours. Infrastructure token Multibit (MULTI) rose 22%; while meme coins pepe (PEPE); alex (ALEX) and pizza (PIZA) rose as much as 60%. PUPS; the token of the Pups Ordinal; lost 22% as traders took profits after a 500% jump over the weekend. Ordinals are a way to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small bitcoin-based transactions. The BRC-20 standard (BRC stands for Bitcoin Request for Comment) was introduced last year to allow users to issue transferable tokens directly through the network for the first time.

In the run-up; implied volatility (IV) on the largest cryptocurrency by market value has ticked higher; suggesting increased price turbulence in the days surrounding the quadrennial event. Still; one observer does not favor placing bullish bets on volatility. ""From a qualitative perspective; I continue to believe paying a volatility premium for a highly predictable outcome (the BTC halving) isn't worth a volatility event premium;"" Greg Magadini; director of derivatives at Amberdata; said in a newsletter on Monday. Traders typically place bullish bets on volatility ahead of binary events; for which the market outcome is uncertain. Moreover; uncertainty opens the door to pre- and post-event price turbulence and has traders buying both call and put options or volatility futures to profit from any price swings. But the impact of Bitcoin's reward halving on its native cryptocurrency and miners has been well documented. The cryptocurrency has historically produced stellar rallies in the 12-18 months following the halving. Read more: Bitcoin Halving; Explained It's important to note that major crypto events like Ethereum's Dencun upgrade; Shanghai upgrade; and spot BTC listings turned out to have little market impact; disappointing traders positioned for an event-led surge in price volatility. ""Not to mention that nearly all the big volatility events in crypto (ETH PoS merge; ETH Shanghai upgrade; BTC spot ETF decision) had disappointed IV [implied volatility]; buyers when RV [realized volatility] failed to materialize by very large margins;"" Magadini noted. Bitcoin's 30-day implied volatility; which gauges the expected price turbulence over four weeks; has increased to an annualized 75% from 68% in a week; according to Amberdata. Meanwhile; the 30-day volatility risk premium (VRP); or the gap between 30-day implied and realized volatilities; has surpassed 10% for the first time since early March. The VRP tends to rise ahead of and following extraordinary market events and can drop to low levels during extended periods of calm markets. ""Options implied volatility is overpricing the event;"" Magadini said; noting the uptick in VRP. Bitcoin changed hands at $71;800 at press time; representing a 3.5% gain on the day. The cryptocurrency has risen over 11% since hitting lows near $64;500 on April 2; CoinDesk data show. The CoinDesk 20 Index; a measure of the broader crypto market; had added 3.8% over 24 hours.

Gold has outperformed; and this may benefit bitcoin (BTC); Coinbase (COIN) said in a research report on Friday. “Given the market’s recent hawkish views on rate cuts; we think gold’s performance signals an overweighting on inflation relative to Fed rate changes as well as an overall belief that certain inflation bumps could materialize more problematically than anticipated;” the report said. “Bitcoin’s increased acceptance as a form of ‘digital gold’ could enable demand from a new subset of investors in this regime;” wrote analyst David Han. “As a result; we think dips are likely to be more aggressively bought compared to previous cycles; even as volatility persists during price discovery.” Among other macroeconomic signals that inflation may not be entirely subdued; the U.S. jobs market continues to surprise to the upside. The economy added 303;000 jobs last month; the government said Friday. That's the strongest headline number since last May and it beat economist forecasts of 200;000 and February’s 270;000 additions. The cryptocurrency’s wider access to capital following the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. could result in less volatility; according to the report. The capital unlocked by spot ETFs “perhaps represents the most fundamental shift in market structure between the previous 2020-21 cycle and today;” Coinbase said. This capital injection; coupled with the bitcoin halving coming later this month and other positive catalysts; makes Coinbase still largely positive on its outlook for crypto markets for the second quarter. The quadrennial halving is when miner rewards are slashed by 50%; thereby reducing the rate of growth in the supply of bitcoin. The next halving is expected to occur around April 20.

And $48 Trillion in Wealth Just Got Access,The ETF-led bitcoin rally has stalled over the past three weeks; at least in part thanks to economic indicators pointing to higher than expected interest rates.,The U.S. jobs market continues to exhibit strength with the government reporting the addition of 303;000 jobs last month. That's the strongest headline number since May 2023 and easily topped economist forecasts for 200;000 and February's 270;000 additions (revised from a previously reported 275;000). The unemployment rate in March dipped to 3.8% against expectations for 3.9% and February's 3.9%. The price of bitcoin (BTC) fell about 0.5% in the minutes following Friday morning's report to $66;000. In traditional markets; U.S. stock index futures gave up a chunk of earlier gains; but are still modestly higher. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose 6.5 basis points to 4.38% and the dollar index added 0.5%. Coming into 2024; markets had priced in as many as five or six U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts to begin as soon as March. The economic data; however; hasn't cooperated. Inflation has actually risen somewhat in the first quarter of the year and job growth has remained robust. March has obviously come and gone with no rate cut and traders ahead of today's numbers had moved expectations of the first rate cut to June or July; according to the CME FedWatch Tool. A total of just three rate cuts are expected for the full year and even that could be too much. Speaking yesterday; Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari suggested the possibility of no rate cuts at all in 2024. His remarks prompted a sharp reversal in stocks; with the major averages closing down more than 1%. Just following today's numbers; swaps trading indicated expectations for the first rate cut had moved out to September. Checking other report details; the labor force participation rate rose to 62.7% from 62.5%; suggesting sizable numbers of people returning to the workforce. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in March; in line with expectations and up from 0.2% in February. On a year-over-year basis; average hourly earnings rose an in line 4.1%; down from 4.3% in February.

The options market shows investors are taking the hint. A death cross occurs when a short-term moving average drops below the long-term moving average; signaling a potential long-term bearish shift in momentum. The ratio's 50-week simple moving average (SMA) appears on track to cross below the 200-week SMA; according to charting platform TradingView. The impending death cross signals risk aversion or prolonged underperformance of ether (ETH) and other altcoins relative to bitcoin (BTC). Since 2017; the crypto market has oscillated between bitcoin-led regimes and altcoin-led regimes. More importantly; altcoin leadership has been characterized by a rising ETH/BTC ratio. In other words; traders are willing to take more risk when ether is outperforming bitcoin and vice versa. The ETH/BTC ratio has dropped nearly 10% to 0.048 this year; TradingView data show . ""The ETHBTC cross is testing a critical support level after breaking below 0.05;"" Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a market note Friday. ""There has been a persistent large selling of ETH calls which has crushed [volatility] and also put some downside pressure on price. Could this again be a very early signal of [bullish] FOMO turning into fear in ETH as a proxy for alts."" The way bitcoin and ether options are currently priced on Deribit; the leading derivatives exchange; also points to expectations for ether underperformance in the near term. At press time; ether puts expiring in seven days; one and two months traded at premiums of 5%; 3% and 0.3%; respectively; to calls. A put option gives the purchaser the right; but not the obligation; to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call option gives the right to buy; so the premium for puts – which provide protection against a price decline – indicates a bearish outlook. In bitcoin's case; the bias was for calls across maturities; excluding seven-day options. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

Now Polychain has put a ribbon on the funding round. In an email to CoinDesk; it declined to disclose the exact amount invested. AI has become an area of interest in the blockchain industry following the proliferation of AI-powered tools and their increased mainstream popularity over the last year or so.

The new APs include Wall Street banking giants Goldman Sachs; Citadel Securities; Citigroup and UBS as well as clearing house ABN AMRO; according to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They join Jane Street Capital; JP Morgan; Masquarie and Virtu Americas. CoinDesk reported in January that Goldman Sachs was looking to play a key role for the bitcoin ETFs and was in talks with issuers about becoming an AP. APs are an integral part of the ETF process as they help create liquidity by changing the supply of shares when there’s a shortage or a surplus. Large ETFs typically have dozens of APs; and in less than three months of existence; IBIT has become fairly sizable with nearly $18 billion in assets under management as of the close yesterday. The participation of Goldman Sachs is particularly notable as its wealth management chief investment officer just this week said the bank believes that crypto has ""no value"" and feels no pressure to participate in the space even as other TradFi giants are taking major steps.

The “move to earn” project brought $26 million in Q1; as previously reported. Move-to-earn; similar to play-to-earn; is a model whereby users are rewarded in cryptocurrency for their step count on the STEPN application. STEPN said it would leverage 5% of the profits to initiate a buyback and burn program for its native GMT tokens. It added that the buyback and burn process “may take a few weeks to complete” in order to avoid causing sudden price volatility. “In addition to the buyback and burn program; STEPN will allocate capital reserves to improve upon existing features and build out the team;” developers said. STEPN said the team had identified several areas where the company will deploy its earned capital in order to improve game play. These include security enhancements; anti-cheating mechanisms to prevent bots from earning GMT; building the developer and core team and seeking out partnerships and/or sponsorship opportunities. GMT prices rose nominally following the earnings release. The tokens traded at 85 cents at press time; and are down 71% from April’s all-time high of $4.11.

The firm has about 650 staff members listed on LinkedIn; including executives; meaning 23% of the company was affected. The layoffs come amid uncertainty for the company as it faces possible insolvency. In June it paused withdrawals citing “extreme market conditions” and has since hired restructuring specialists. The company said it is exploring options to “preserve and protect assets” following its mid-June turmoil. Goldman Sachs (GS) is said to be leading a $2 billion raise from investors to purchase Celsius’s distressed assets. Crypto exchange FTX; however; is said to have passed on a deal to purchase the lender after examining its finances. Celsius joins a growing of crypto firms letting go of staff amid bearish market conditions. Coinbase (COIN) laid off over 1;100 employees in June; with exchanges Bybit; Huobi; Banxa and several others letting go of staff in the past month.

The individual was revealed by CoinFLEX CEO Mark Lamb to be prominent crypto investor Roger Ver; a claim that Ver denied on social media. In Saturday’s post; CoinFLEX said it holds more than 26 million FLEX tokens – valued at over $7 million at current rates – in its inventory. It added that resuming trades would cause market volatility in FLEX's price; which would inadvertently affect the collateral positions of platform users. The company also said that it is looking to raise a significant amount of funds from investors; including by using customer deposits in exchange for equity. “There are a number of investors in this group of large depositors who have indicated that they may be in a position to help the business move forward if we can all find a workable solution;” the firm said. Recovering the delinquent debt; however; could help buffer FLEX prices and prevent a steep drop; CoinFLEX said. “We believe the recovery of the debt will help build confidence in and will help shore up the trading price of FLEX Coin;” it said. FLEX fell from $4.20 to $1.60 in late June as CoinFLEX went public with its losses; CoinGecko data shows. The lack of a swift recovery plan has added to the losses; with the tokens now down 94% in the past 30 days. Meanwhile; CoinFLEX said that it hopes to make 10% of customers’ balances available for withdrawal in the next week; adding that the arbitration process could “take up to 12 months.” Disclosure Please note that our privacy policy; terms of use; cookies; and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

Trading volume in futures and options tied to cryptocurrencies on centralized exchanges rose 86.5% to a record high of $6.18 trillion; translating to three times of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. Still; the market dominance of derivatives slipped to 67.8%; the lowest since December 2022 as traders flocked to the spot market; where cryptocurrencies are exchanged for immediate delivery. Spot trading volume jumped 108% to $2.94 trillion; the highest monthly volume since May 2021. The combined spot and derivatives trading volume increased 92.9% to a record $9.12 trillion. ""The spike in spot trading activity on centralized exchanges coincides with the growing excitement around Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs and the initial signs of returning retail participants in the market;"" CCData's monthly report said. Derivatives are often criticized for creating artifical demand and supply via leverage; injecting volatility into the market and are considered a proxy for speculative activity often observed at major market tops. As such; the decline in derivatives' share of the total market activity might be a good news for crypto bulls anticipating a continued price rally. Bitcoin (BTC); the leading cryptocurrency by market value; rose 16.6% in March; setting new record highs above $73;000; CoinDesk data show. Prices rose over 68% in the first quarter. The CoinDesk 20 Index; a broader market gauge; jumped over 50% in the first three months. Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

29,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/04/hedge-funds-hold-record-bearish-bitcoin-bets-data-show/,CoinDesk,article,Hedge Funds Hold Record Bearish Bitcoin Bets; Data Show,"Most funds may have taken short positions as a part of a ""carry trade;"" one observer said.","Leveraged funds; which the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) describes as hedge funds and commodity trading advisers; held record bearish wagers on the bitcoin (BTC) price at the end of the first quarter as the cryptocurrency's rally stalled near record highs. Hedge funds boosted their net short positions in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (CME) standard bitcoin futures contracts to 16;102. That's the most since the futures began trading in late 2017; according to CFTC figures published last week. CME's standard bitcoin futures contracts are sized at 5 BTC. A short futures position is a trading strategy in which a trader sells a futures contract to profit from or hedge against an expected drop in the underlying asset's price. Carry traders or arbitrageurs short futures while simultaneously buying the asset to safely pocket the price differential between the spot and futures market. The record buildup in short positions likely reflects hedge funds' renewed interest in the carry trade; according to Markus Thielen; CEO of 10x Research. ""There is a massive demand from hedge funds to put on carry trades. Despite bitcoin’s -10% decline from the all-time high; the futures premium has remained in double digits; and hedge funds are taking advantage of these high rates;"" Thielen told CoinDesk in an interview. While bitcoin's bullish momentum stalled after hitting record highs above $73;500 in March; CME futures continue to trade at an annualized three-month premium of over 10%; according to Velo Data. In other words; carry trades still yield at least twice as much as the 10-year Treasury note; which offered a so-called risk-free return of 4.36% at press time. That said; some hedge funds may have taken outright bearish bets as recent robust U.S. economic data and hawkish comments from the Fed officials weakened the case for rapid-fire interest-rate cuts in the near term. On Wednesday; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell emphasized the need to see how inflation evolves in the coming months; keeping the timing of the first-rate cut uncertain. Since the release of upbeat manufacturing data on Monday; the probability of the Fed cutting rates in June has dropped below 50%. In addition; some observers are skeptical that the impending mining reward halving will live up to its bullish reputation. The Bitcoin blockchain's fourth mining reward halving; due later this month; reduces the per-block amount of BTC issued as a reward to miners to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC. Historically; bitcoin has chalked out major bull runs 12 to 18 months after halving; when the reduced per-block emission met demand. If past data is a guide; the path of least resistance is higher. However; according to David Duong; head of institutional research at Coinbase; the small sample size makes it difficult to draw definite conclusions in a market fundamentally altered by the January debut of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. ""We believe that bitcoin’s market dynamics have fundamentally changed with the advent of U.S. spot BTC ETFs;"" Duong said in a market update last month. ""Their multi-billion dollar net inflows in just two months have irrevocably altered the landscape. With major institutional players now capable of taking exposure through these vehicles; bitcoin's response to the upcoming halving may not necessarily mirror its performance in prior cycles."" ""We think studies of previous cycles should be interpreted cautiously; as the small sample size makes it difficult to generalize patterns here;"" he said. The launch of spot ETFs brought lifted bitcoin to record highs ahead of the halving; as opposed to previous cycles. That has left the door open for a post-halving price drop. Analysts at JPMorgan foresee bitcoin falling to $42;000 after the halving hype subsides. At press time; bitcoin changed hands near $66;000. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

The options market shows investors are taking the hint. A death cross occurs when a short-term moving average drops below the long-term moving average; signaling a potential long-term bearish shift in momentum. The ratio's 50-week simple moving average (SMA) appears on track to cross below the 200-week SMA; according to charting platform TradingView. The impending death cross signals risk aversion or prolonged underperformance of ether (ETH) and other altcoins relative to bitcoin (BTC). Since 2017; the crypto market has oscillated between bitcoin-led regimes and altcoin-led regimes. More importantly; altcoin leadership has been characterized by a rising ETH/BTC ratio. In other words; traders are willing to take more risk when ether is outperforming bitcoin and vice versa. The ETH/BTC ratio has dropped nearly 10% to 0.048 this year; TradingView data show . ""The ETHBTC cross is testing a critical support level after breaking below 0.05;"" Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a market note Friday. ""There has been a persistent large selling of ETH calls which has crushed [volatility] and also put some downside pressure on price. Could this again be a very early signal of [bullish] FOMO turning into fear in ETH as a proxy for alts."" The way bitcoin and ether options are currently priced on Deribit; the leading derivatives exchange; also points to expectations for ether underperformance in the near term. At press time; ether puts expiring in seven days; one and two months traded at premiums of 5%; 3% and 0.3%; respectively; to calls. A put option gives the purchaser the right; but not the obligation; to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call option gives the right to buy; so the premium for puts – which provide protection against a price decline – indicates a bearish outlook. In bitcoin's case; the bias was for calls across maturities; excluding seven-day options. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

If approved; the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF could be the first spot bitcoin ETF in Australia which allows direct holding of bitcoin. Australia already has two exchange-traded products providing exposure to spot crypto assets on Cboe Australia but they do not hold bitcoin directly. The Monochrome Bitcoin ETF is a flagship product of the firm. It could have also been listed with Cboe Australia's larger rival; ASX; where larger volumes are available. In January 2024; Monochrome Asset Management's head of legal and compliance Derek Vladimir Henningsen told CoinDesk that they anticipated their bitcoin ETF would be listed in the second quarter of the year. The announcement said the firm selected Cboe Australia as the listing venue for its bitcoin ETF because it aligns with its strategic goals to work with a market operator with an established reputation; strategic position and expertise across Asia; and broader investor access. In Australia; unlike the U.S.; firms have to first get approval from the regulator; the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC); and then apply to an exchange for listing the product. Monochrome has already got approval from ASIC for its product. ""We expect a decision from Cboe Australia about our bitcoin ETF application before the middle of the year;"" said Jeff Yew; Monochrome Asset Management CEO.

But in May 2022; the UST de-pegged and began a death spiral that eventually took down the entire Terra ecosystem; wiping out approximately $40 billion in market value in its wake. During its case; the SEC argued that Kwon and; under his direction; Terraform Labs deceived everyday investors about the nature of that algorithm; implying that it allowed UST to “naturally heal” and “automatically self-heal” in the event of a de-peg. But there was no self-healing or algorithmic magic that kept UST pegged to the dollar; the SEC argued. Instead; the value of UST was maintained through continuous trading activity; including large-scale trading done by institutional investors. During her closing arguments on Friday; SEC attorney Laura Meehan told the jury that during a prior de-peg in May 2021; Kwon and Terraform Labs made a “secret agreement” with Jump; a trading shop that acted as a market maker for Terraform Labs; to step in and buy millions of dollars of UST off-chain to inflate the value and bring it back to parity with the dollar. Meehan added that after Jump’s intervention; Kwon and his company intentionally kept Jump’s involvement quiet; wanting instead to use the re-pegging as evidence of the algorithm’s effectiveness. “Defendants lied for years. They lied about the success and size of their blockchain … they lied about the stability of their algorithm;” Meehan said. “They’re still parading themselves around like they’re a real company; like they’re legitimate.” As Meehan neared the end of her remarks; the Manhattan courtroom gently shook – not; as District Court Judge Jed Rakoff quipped; “with the force of the SEC’s arguments” but with the tremors of a 4.8 magnitude earthquake in neighboring New Jersey. Lawyers for Terraform Labs and Do Kwon made their closing arguments after the SEC; pausing intermittently as emergency alerts for the earthquake periodically sounded from cell phones across the courtroom. The defense; led by attorney Louis Pellegrino; told the jury that the mobile payment app Chai did; in fact; utilize the Terra blockchain for a variety of things; including refunding purchases and providing liquidity. But mostly; Pellegrino’s argument focused on the alleged “secret agreement” between Jump and Terraform Labs; and whether or not Kwon and his company had actually lied to investors about the nature of the algorithm. “The mechanism was not a computer that functioned on its own;” Pellegrino said. “It wasn’t some magical machine…and everyone knew it.” Minting-and-burning to maintain the peg had to be done by market participants; he argued; and Kwon and Terraform Labs had “never claimed” otherwise. Those market participants included companies like Jump – which Pellegrino said had a formal agreement; not a secret one; to provide liquidity to Terraform Labs when needed. “All reasonable purchasers knew about the risks;” Pellegrino argued; pointing to a trading memo from Galaxy Digital citing the inherent risk of a collapse of the ecosystem. When that collapse eventually came; Pellegrino said; it was as the result of a devastating short attack – carried out by hedge funds including Wintermute Trading; Celsius; and Jane Street – that made Terraform Labs a victim alongside its investors. “Terraform is still here; trying to make things better;” Pellegrino said. “Terraform is no house of cards.” Terraform Labs filed for bankruptcy protection in January. During his testimony earlier this week; current CEO Chris Amani testified that the company had approximately $150 million in assets remaining and that he made an annual salary of $3 million. Former CEO and defendant Do Kwon was absent from court for the duration of the trial. Kwon remains in Montenegro; where he has been since his March 2023 arrest for using fake Costa Rican travel documents en route to Dubai after months on the lam. Kwon served a prison sentence for his crime but was released on bail and placed under house arrest in the Balkan country last month. The country’s Supreme Court is currently weighing competing extradition requests from the U.S. and South Korea; Kwon’s native country; which both want to try him on criminal fraud charges in addition to civil ones. Kwon’s ultimate destination remains unclear. Read More: Do Kwon Released From Montenegrin Prison on Bail; Terraform Labs' Civil Trial Begins in NYC (coindesk.com) Edited by Jesse Hamilton.

According to the team: ""It is a community-owned data treasury where users can join with their Reddit account and receive governance rights based on how much data they contribute. Users can then vote to sell their data to other AI companies or vote to delete it if Reddit agrees to pay them directly. The DAO demonstrates the power of user-owned data; the potential for user-owned foundation models; and the sorts of applications Vana is making possible."" April 4: Drife; a Web3 decentralized ride-hailing platform that uses blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer network for drivers and riders; is migrating to the Sui blockchain. According to the team: ""This is the first decentralized mobility infrastructure platform to integrate on Sui. The Drife platform offers a zero-commission fee structure which allows drivers to earn more income and pass on the benefits to riders in the form of savings. Sui is the optimal blockchain platform for Drife as it offers low network fees; reduced transaction costs; and enhanced overall affordability for users."" According to the project's documentation; it was built on Polygon. Edited by Bradley Keoun.

""The stablecoin market is over $150 billion today and is forecasted to exceed $2.8 trillion by 2028;"" Ripple said in a statement shared with CoinDesk. ""There’s clear demand for stablecoins that deliver trust; stability and utility."" The company said the token; which it plans to release ""later this year;"" will be ""100% backed by U.S. dollar deposits; short-term U.S. government Treasuries and other cash equivalents."" The stablecoin will be deployed onto Ripple's institution-focused XRP Ledger along with the Ethereum blockchain to start out; and it will be based on Ethereum's ERC-20 token standard. Ripple's announcement comes as stablecoins have proven one of the most popular types of digital assets among crypto traders; free (in theory) from the price volatility witnessed in larger cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum's ether (ETH). Read more: What is a Stablecoin? ""What we think is going to be our differentiator is going to be the fact that the assets are going to be in dollars; Treasuries – rock solid;"" Ripple CTO David Schwartz told CoinDesk in an interview. ""We're not trying to juice the last couple of decimal points out of this. We're looking to conquer the market and be in it for the long term."" As for why Ripple – still battling an enforcement case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission – has decided to jump into the stablecoin game; Schwartz said that the decision; in part; came down to simple ""dollars and cents."" ""Part of it is just opportunistic. It's a growing market;"" he said. ""You could be a bank that pays no interest. That seems like a pretty good business opportunity."" Schwartz said the new stablecoin could also help breathe some life into the XRP Ledger's decentralized finance ecosystem; which has a decentralized exchange but relatively low usage relative to other chains. According to Schwartz; transparency – historically a key point of scrutiny for stablecoin issuers – will be a key focus for Ripple as it rolls out its new token. ""We're gonna have public audits on a monthly basis; hopefully by a top-tier accounting firm and will disclose more on that later;"" said Schwartz. ""We're aiming for complete transparency. You know; we'll do whatever we need to do to address those issues."" Beyond the promise of transparency; Schwartz emphasized that the potential growth of the stablecoin market – currently dominated by Tether's USDT token and Circle's USDC – serves as a disincentive for Ripple or any other stablecoin provider to act dishonestly. Coinbase; the publicly traded U.S. crypto exchange; is an investor in Circle. ""In the early days of Tether; people were expecting it to blow up any day; and they felt like it was really sketchy;"" said Schwartz. But now; ""if you're Tether; it wouldn't make sense for you to run off with people's money;"" said Schwartz. ""Even if that was your plan; you'd wait to do it"" because ""the market is only growing."" In Ripple's case; ""we're not trying to squeeze a couple of extra pennies out – we don't need to;"" said Schwartz. ""Our balance sheet is rock solid."" The Ripple CTO said his token will be aimed primarily at enterprise customers and banking institutions; organizations for whom ""those kinds of practical arguments aren't really prescient because they have to justify their decisions"" to ""stockholders and to regulators and so on."" To satisfy the needs of this market segment; Ripple says it is using U.S. banks to hold its reserves and is taking what it terms a ""compliance-first mindset."" USDC is currently the market leader among compliance-oriented stablecoin consumers; but Schwartz said he doesn't see it as ""a winner takes all"" environment. ""If we were a solid number three and the market grows 12x; that's not a failure scenario;"" said Schwartz. ""Obviously we would like to do better than that; but that's not a failure case; that's still pretty gosh darn good."" Edited by Bradley Keoun.

36,https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/05/ethereum-foundation-researchers-proposal-to-slow-eth-issuance-draws-pushback/,CoinDesk,article,Ethereum Foundation Researchers' Proposal to Slow ETH Issuance Draws Pushback,The proposal; introduced in February; could harden Ethereum's native cryptocurrency; ether (ETH); as a form of money – by reducing the inflation of new supply. But some members of the community say if it's not broke; don't fix it. Reduction in ETH staking yield What is the role of the Ethereum Foundation?,"Earlier this year; a pair of Ethereum Foundation (EF) researchers put forth a proposal to reduce the pace of new issuance of ether (ETH) tokens. It was part of a concerted plan to reduce incentives for new stakers – the investors who lock cryptocurrency into the blockchain as a way of helping to secure the network. The freshly minted ETH is a crucial component of the rewards these investors hope to receive; in the form of staking yields. As the researchers' thinking went; there's already enough stakers to provide effective security for the blockchain; and in fact any additional increases in the level of participation could enable the unwanted dominance of fast-growing third-party staking platforms like Lido. A side benefit of the proposed changes would be to harden ether as a form of money; since the total supply of the cryptocurrency wouldn't grow as quickly – effectively tapering ether's inflation rate. Now; though; some members of the community are pushing back; questioning whether there's really a need to change the tokenomics of ether and; in the extreme; whether the Ethereum Foundation plays an outsize role in influencing code upgrades on the decentralized network. The proposal was initially introduced in February by Ansgar Dietrichs and Caspar Schwarz-Schilling; both researchers at the EF. It suggests setting the blockchain's parameters so that the annual issuance of new ETH would not exceed 0.4% – a step change lower than the current effective limit of 1.5%. The big idea is that top Ethereum researchers are satisfied with the number of stakers already working to secure the network; so it might make sense to reduce the incentives for newcomers. The change would also avoid extra dilution for ETH investors. The current issuance rate ""dilutes ETH holders beyond what is necessary for security;"" the researchers wrote. They estimated that the proposal would reduce ETH staking yields by nearly a third. Some members of the Ethereum community argue that the proposal is being rushed ahead without enough time for outside feedback. Viktor Bunin; a protocol specialist at Coinbase Cloud; wrote on the social-media platform X; “If it's not broke don't fix it.” ETH staking is the main way the Ethereum network stays secure: Ethereum's ""proof-of-stake"" consensus model lets users deposit (""stake"") ETH with the network in exchange for yield; and to help run the chain. The substance of Dietrichs and Schwarz-Schilling's concern is that too many ETH tokens are getting staked with the network via third-party liquid staking services like Lido – crypto protocols that stake on behalf of users; and then issue derivative assets called ""liquid staking tokens"" (LSTs) representing their users' underlying deposits. The EF researchers say they're concerned that LSTs like Lido's stETH token – the most-traded asset on Ethereum other than the ETH token itself – could eventually replace the blockchain’s native currency as the network's de facto money; making the entire system less secure. Ethereum's security model needs ETH to be valuable in order to work; and a chief concern driving the new proposal is that if the cryptocurrency were to fall behind LSTs; it could go down in price relative to other assets. Mike Neuder; another researcher at the EF; expanded on the initial proposal by explaining that; as “real yield from staking goes to zero;"" stakers will need to ""rely on exogenous rewards for profitability.” Reducing the ETH issuance rate could enhance Ethereum's economic model by making ETH scarcer; potentially increasing its value. Some community members; however; are pushing back on the argument that changing the tokenomics of the blockchain will improve Ethereum’s economic model. Jon Charbonneau; co-founder at crypto investment firm DBA; wrote on X that “these tweaks try to solve an unsolvable problem of fundamental tradeoffs in PoS.” PoS stands for ""proof-of-stake;"" which is the core process or ""consensus mechanism"" used to secure the blockchain. Paul Dylan-Ennis; a lecturer and assistant professor at the University College Dublin School of Business; wrote that “it seems to me it's not really issuance that is at stake; so much as people have a sense that EF-associated devs and researchers appear to have an outsized power.” He added that “they are not engaging in the appropriate level of 'rough consensus' from the wider set of stakeholders.” The skepticism elicted responses from key figures within the Ethereum ecosystem; and at the Ethereum Foundation specifically. Notably; Vitalik Buterin; the influential co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain; is one of three members of the executive board of the Ethereum Foundation; according to its website. The organization is described as a ""non-profit that supports the Ethereum ecosystem;"" and part of a ""larger community of organizations and individuals that fund protocol development; grow the ecosystem and advocate for Ethereum."" Tim Beiko; protocol support lead at the foundation; pushed back on Dylan-Ennis’ commentary; arguing that “it's pretty empirically untrue that 'core devs' or 'the EF' are uncontested re: governance. this current conversation is a clear example.” ""Core devs"" is shorthand for the broader; group of developers – drawn from multiple companies and organizations; as well as individuals – who participate in regular discussions over the network's rules; code; upgrades and strategy roadmap. Beiko added that: “I think core devs + researchers generally treat ethresearch+ethmag as a place to post WIP ideas/proposals; whereas the broader community tends to perceive it as a place where the Official Roadmap gets shared after it's ~final.” Dietrichs; the co-author of the initial proposal; responded that the ""intention was purely to propose this change for consideration to the community."" “Of course any change to such a sensitive part of the protocol requires broad community buy-in;"" Dietrichs wrote. ""We tried to be clear about that from the beginning; but could certainly have done a better job.” Read more: Ethereum Finalizes 'Dencun' Upgrade; in Landmark Move to Reduce Data Fees Disclosure Please note that our privacy policy; terms of use; cookies; and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

37,https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/01/26/which-is-the-best-self-custody-lightning-wallet/,CoinDesk,article,Which Is the Best Self-Custody Lightning Wallet?,Bitcoin educator Anita Posch tested the Blixt; Green; Mutiny; Phoenix and Zeus Lightning wallets while traveling in Zimbabwe. Lightning wallets tested and goal Choosing the test location The testing process Payment costs Features and differences Second test in urban area with LTE connection Overall rankings for Lightning self-custody Conclusion,"I'm conducting my second test of self-custodial Lightning wallets in Zimbabwe; to see which might be best for any rural area. Given that none of the available self-custodial wallets are developed by Africans; they are rarely used or tested here. On top of that; Lightning is still new and complex; building mobile apps that are running a node of the network on your phone is challenging. I am here to find out what works and what does not. As an educator; I recommend tools for everyday users; who want to send small payments. These tools have to be reliable; otherwise people might conclude that Bitcoin isn't for them. Anita Posch is a world-renowned Bitcoin educator; author of the book ""(L)earn Bitcoin"" and founder of the online academy Crack the Orange as well as non-profit initiative Bitcoin for Fairness. I opened my first Lightning channel on an app called BLW in January 2019. I’m used to testing new tools; that’s why I have no problem if challenges and bugs arise. But regular users may not be as forgiving; that’s why I aim to only recommend tools I’ve personally tested. In 2023; the only two self-custody Lightning wallets available were Breez and Phoenix. This year I had more choices and tested: Blixt; Mutiny; Green; Zeus and Phoenix. I also included the Wallet of Satoshi; a custodial wallet; just to see how it performs in comparison. I was familiar with Phoenix and used Zeus connected to my Voltage node earlier. Mutiny; Blixt and the Lightning integration in Blockstream’s Green wallet just popped up in the last few months; so using them was new for me too. All of the wallets have been undergoing huge changes and will continue to evolve. I had to download Mutiny manually and install a special .apk file used on Android phones. For the Green wallet; I asked BlockStream to unlock its experimental Greenlight feature in order to test it. My goal was to find out which of the wallets are the best in sending and receiving bitcoin in a reliable; fast; easy to use manner and to compare the costs involved. See also: Coinbase CEO Confirms Exchange Will Support Lightning Before heading to the rural areas (I intended to test the wallets under suboptimal conditions); I set up the wallets and opened a Lightning payments channel in Harare as I anticipated low internet signal challenges. Based on my year-long experience in Zimbabwe; I’ve learned that even with decent internet speed; the upload and download of files as small as 2 MB can be problematic. I used the internet at a friend’s house to use the fastest internet provider in Harare called Liquid; which is also the most expensive with a monthly cost of $300 for unlimited usage. My speed test results for download were 92.7 Mbps and upload 14.6 Mbps. Even with that fast internet it took me some time to install the apps; secure the private keys and open a Lightning channel to be a part of the network. To ensure consistency; I followed a test protocol for each wallet. On Dec. 26 and 27; I installed the wallets and sent 100;000 sats (~$42 at current prices) to open a Lightning channel. A channel on the Lightning Network needs two transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain to be set up. That way the channel is constantly connected to the blockchain; which is why the bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain and bitcoin on the Lightning network are the same. There is no difference in the value; it’s the same unit; not another token or asset. There are several ways to open a channel: sending on-chain bitcoin; transferring Lightning directly from another wallet or through a swap from Liquid or some wallets are offering buying inbound liquidity. I tried them all to send the first bitcoin to the wallets; affecting set-up speed and fees I had to pay. See also: Bitcoin Could See Growth in Layer-2 Ecosystem; Drawing on Ethereum's Experience I used a Lightning payment to open a channel on all wallets; except for Blixt; as I only found the on-chain option there (except for liquidity providers). Seemingly; Blixt is opening the channel with a second on-chain transaction while the other wallets conceal that second transaction somehow; because the channel opened immediately after the first transaction confirmation. Not with Blixt: I sent the first transaction and the confirmation took some hours; it was evening already; so I had to leave the friend's house. As soon as it was confirmed; Blixt carried out the second on-chain transaction; which took again several hours because the mempool was full. When the second transaction was confirmed I was back in the house where I'm living; with internet speed only around 3 Mbps download; 0.26 upload and a Ping over 300ms. Blixt wasn't able to open the channel in these circumstances. I needed to go back to my friend's house to finish the channel opening. It's hard to say how other wallets would have performed under these conditions. For the channel openings on Green and Zeus; I used Liquid; swapped via Boltz.exchange to Lightning; due to high transaction fees at the time. Opening a channel from Liquid is far more economical in that situation. Liquid is a sidechain of Bitcoin; its unit is called L-BTC. Learn the differences between Bitcoin; Lightning; Liquid; and E-Cash in this non-technical explainer. One BTC is pegged to one L-BTC. This means if you peg-in 0.1 BTC to Liquid; the resulting 0.1 L-BTC are of the same value as BTC. Compared to self-custodial Lightning there is more trust involved in using Liquid; because you have to go through intermediaries for the peg-in and peg-out and trust a federation of 15 companies; who are the signers for Liquid transactions; whereas on Bitcoin and Lightning you don‘t have to trust any intermediaries. The upside of the Liquid blockchain is that the transaction speed; privacy are higher and currently the fees are lower than on the Bitcoin blockchain. I compared all network fees; transaction; and service fees that applied with the different methods of opening a channel. The cost of the incoming transaction to open the channel was the highest with Blixt as I used bitcoin on-chain at a time when the average fee rate was 110 sat/vByte ($0.000054). Channel opening was the cheapest when using Lightning directly from another LN wallet. The route using Liquid and Boltz was a little bit more expensive than using Lightning. The available balance after opening the channel varied significantly. Zeus had the lowest balance of 52;500 sats; while Green had the highest at 97;500 sats. This difference was surprising; especially since I used Liquid for both. Green was the clear winner with a cost of 3.5%; whereas Zeus was by far the most expensive wallet with 48.5% of the funds spent in opening the channel. Mutiny offered the biggest channel capacity and the highest receivable amount with 100;000 sats; while at the same time it was the second most expensive. However; a drawback of Green was its limited incoming capacity of only 4;133 sats. After the initial set-up; I set out to do the payment test on Jan. 1; 2024. I strolled through the scorching heat; making my way up to the kopje; navigating through rocks; grass; bushes and trees 30 km out of the capitaI Harare. My friends were captivated by the beautiful flowers that bloom as soon as the rainy season begins. My focus; however; was on finding a decent internet signal for my two phones. Having prepared the test back in Harare; I was eager to carry it out in this setting. After 30 minutes of searching; I realized that the network coverage was inconsistent; regardless of whether I used NetOne or Econet. I was able to send WhatsApp messages; but as soon as I wanted to download an image with 0.5 MB; I had to wait or turn airplane mode on and off to be back in the game. Finally; I settled on a shaded spot with a stable NetOne signal to set up a hotspot for my other devices. I prepared my devices – my Google Pixel 4; iPhone 13 Pro and my iPad Air (3rd generation). The iPad was included because I already had Phoenix wallets on my other two devices; and for this test; I wanted to start with a fresh installation. Now seated on some rocks; surrounded by trees and bushes; as I fend off large ants attempting to crawl up under my trousers I found 4.21 Mbps download and 0.36 Mbps upload. Glad that I set up the apps already a few days earlier. See also: Bitcoin and Stablecoins Will Bring Crypto Mass Adoption to Africa My speed test results showed a ping of 90 and a download speed of 4.6 Mbps and an upload speed 0.5 Mbps. When I started testing the wallets; the Phoenix wallet opened immediately. The Green wallet took 13 seconds to open and the Mutiny wallet needed 18 seconds. However; Zeus didn't open at all; even after a 150-second wait. Similarly; Blixt opened but failed to sync the channels and wallet; so I couldn't use it. As expected; the custodial Wallet of Satoshi opened immediately. My first test was to send 50;000 sats from the different wallets to my Phoenix wallet on my iPhone. So; the Phoenix wallet on the iPhone was on the receiving end. Unfortunately; I could not send from Blixt because; as I said before; it did not sync at all. Zeus was also unusable since it wouldn't even start up. When I attempted a payment with Zeus; it failed after a five minute wait. The Green wallet's payment attempt was unsuccessful too; displaying an error message after I waited for two and a half minutes. With the Mutiny wallet; I almost wanted to stop but after 50 seconds; I was able to send the payment successfully. The Phoenix wallet was the quickest; completing the transfer in just three seconds. And interestingly; the custodial Wallet of Satoshi was slower than Phoenix; taking nine seconds for the payment to go through. I didn't anticipate this result; but I found it amusing. The next test focused on receiving 30;000 sats from the Phoenix wallet on my iPhone; which had previously served as the receiving wallet. The results were somewhat similar to the previous test. The time until the payment was sent from Phoenix was three seconds and it showed up in Mutiny; Phoenix and the Wallet of Satoshi immediately. Blixt did not work. With Green; the payment failed after I waited for 35 seconds. Similarly; Zeus also failed to receive the payment after I waited for one and half minutes. For this test; I sent 20;000 sats to a Lightning address; using the Wallet of Satoshi as the recipient since I had access to its Lightning address. The results were somewhat consistent with previous tests but with a notable exception. Surprisingly; the Green wallet managed to send to a Lightning address this time; completing the payment in 40 seconds. This was unexpected given its previous failures in other tests. Blixt and Zeus didn't work. Mutiny; Phoenix and Wallet of Satoshi; as anticipated; successfully completed the payments to a Lightning address. I wanted to test whether I could exchange 20;000 sats for Liquid in these conditions; just to be confident in recommending it to my followers. For the Lightning to Liquid swap I was using the Boltz.exchange website; with the Green wallet set as the recipient. I didn't attempt the swap with Blixt; Green and Zeus since their earlier payment attempts had failed. Surprisingly Mutiny failed in this swap; the payment did not go through even after I waited for two minutes. Both Phoenix and the Wallet of Satoshi successfully completed the swap from Lightning to Liquid Bitcoin. Also here the custodial Wallet of Satoshi was slower compared to the self-custodial Phoenix wallet. The differences in fees for the payments were marginal; just around 100 to 200 sats; which is negligible. The costs for sending and receiving were roughly the same across different wallets. However; the costs associated with opening a channel varied significantly. Notably; the Green wallet was the cheapest option; requiring only 3% of the transferred amount as fees. On the other hand; Zeus was the most expensive in these terms. In terms of payment reliability; Phoenix and the Wallet of Satoshi stood out as the most dependable. This isn't surprising for the Wallet of Satoshi; given its custodial nature. Following closely was Mutiny; which successfully completed three out of four payment attempts. Green; however; managed only one successful payment out of four. Phoenix showed remarkable reliability; successfully processing all four payments. I even managed to send 11 sats from my Phoenix wallet to my Alby Lightning address under very challenging conditions with a download rate of only 0.15 Mbps; upload speed of 0.05 Mbps; and a ping of 185. Phoenix stands out as the clear winner in terms of payment speed. It was even faster than the custodial Wallet of Satoshi. Green and Mutiny also show satisfactory performance; provided they functioned correctly. I evaluated the wallets' features; focusing on their user-friendliness and security aspects. How easy is it to do a backup? Is the wallet open source? How well are the wallet users guided to ensure highest security standards are applied without their actions compromising them? I focused on the backup process; particularly favoring 12-word seed phrases; because this results in acceptable security and randomness for the private keys and it's easier to store 12 words than 24. Green and Phoenix use 12-word seeds; while Blixt; Mutiny and Zeus opt for 24-word seeds. A key aspect of product design is encouraging users to adopt high-security measures seamlessly. Being forced to write down the backup while opening the wallet is one of these good design features. I call it “forced backup” and only Green offers it. All the other wallets show a call to action only. Conversely; permitting the seed phrase to be copied to the device's clipboard for convenience may compromise the security of the funds. Uninformed users and newbies might copy it; send their seed per email to themselves; store it as a screenshot or in a Word document. I have seen it all. Convenience is the enemy of security. While it's true that users should only store small amounts in a Lightning wallet; it's also a fact that users will apply the same unsafe behavior to an on-chain wallet; because why not? Blixt allows copying the seed. Mutiny and Zeus too; but they at least warn their users. Green and Zeus are doing it the right way and prevent copying the seed; aligning with best security practices. I think cloud backups on the user side are not desirable. They can be a double-edged sword; offering convenience but also presenting potential security risks and accessibility issues. Many people in African countries don't have a Google Drive or iCloud account to secure their channels. For added security; I prefer to use a PIN; password; or pattern lock to secure a Bitcoin wallet. Otherwise; for example in case a security officer at an airport or a thief wants me to open my wallet; I can be forced to use my fingerprint or my Face ID. Blixt; Mutiny; Green and Zeus offer password or PIN-based security. Phoenix provided biometric options such as face ID or fingerprint recognition only; but I hope they consider making changes to this feature. See also: Gridless Uses Bitcoin Mining to Power Rural Africa A significant feature I value is whether the wallets offer a separate on-chain Bitcoin wallet. This is a great feature as users only need to install one app for Bitcoin and Lightning. Blixt; Mutiny; Green and Zeus provide a separate on-chain Bitcoin wallet. Phoenix does not. While it allows for swapping in and out; the functionality is integrated and not separated as a distinct Bitcoin wallet. Coin control is going to be more and more important as transaction fees are rising. We need Bitcoin mobile wallets allowing us to do coin control and choose different UTXOs for a transaction. Sadly; none of the tested wallets allows that. This limitation impacts users' ability to manage transaction costs effectively. While Green does offer coin control; it's only available in their desktop version; not on mobile. A Lightning address; similar in format to an email address; is a convenient feature that allows you to receive Lightning payments asynchronously without requiring the wallet to be actively open. Blixt offers a LN address in their experimental feature called ""Lightning Box."" Zeus is using hodl invoices; a solution that has been criticized by a few developers because of the complexity and the fact that holding invoices could affect the performance of the Lightning Network overall. The other self-custody wallets do not offer Lightning addresses. Given this; it might be a better option to use custodial services like getalby.com or the Wallet of Satoshi for a Lightning address and to send the sats to a Bitcoin; Lightning or Liquid self-custody wallet from time to time. All the wallets allow payments to Lightning addresses. Only Phoenix offers auto channels at the moment. This means Phoenix is more convenient than other wallets; because you only have to set up one channel. The channel then dynamically adjusts its size if you send more funds to it than its liquidity allows. To keep your channel size consistent; you should not swap out to on-chain bitcoin as it reduces the size of the channel. In terms of fee settings; all wallets except Mutiny allow you to define the maximum Lightning fee you're willing to pay. This gives users some control over their payment costs. Regarding channel management; all wallets allow you to force close the channels. Additionally; Blixt; Zeus and Phoenix allow you to purchase inbound liquidity. After returning to town I tested the payments that failed a second time. I realized that Green’s experimental mode is really very experimental; because I could not send a single Lightning payment with Green and other people reported the same in the Blockstream Telegram group. Blixt was still not able to sync to the top of the blockchain and after five minutes of waiting I stopped the process. Zeus was able to sync and started the node; but then LND was taking a long time to get Zeus “ready to make payments” and after three minutes of waiting I closed the app. From my educator's perspective; my top choices are the Phoenix and Mutiny wallet. Everything works with Phoenix; you don’t need to worry about channel management and payments are even faster than with the custodial Wallet of Satoshi. The fees for payments in Phoenix might be off-putting; from that perspective one might look into Mutiny as it is convincing due to its user-friendliness; making it ideal for beginners. Mutiny’s channel opening was more expensive though and it doesn’t offer auto channels. Part of their business model is the optional Mutiny+ subscription for 16;000 sats per month. Green would be a strong recommendation; particularly for those who value additional options like Liquid and on-chain transactions in a single wallet with one seed. As long as their Lightning payments aren’t working; it’s a no-go obviously. Blixt and Zeus are more suited for advanced users due to their range of options; but they did not work in my tests. To choose the optimal wallet; it’s important to ask yourself what are the main goals and the features you’ll need. I've developed an online learning program that could help guide you in that endeavor. In summary; the evaluation of self-custodial Lightning wallets in rural Zimbabwe in 2024 revealed important insights. Wallets like Phoenix; Mutiny; Green; Zeus and Blixt were tested for their performance; reliability and user-friendliness. Opening channels with these wallets varied in cost and balance. Phoenix and the Wallet of Satoshi exhibited high reliability and speed; with Phoenix performing better than the custodial Wallet of Satoshi. From an educational standpoint; the wallets' features were assessed; emphasizing user-friendliness and security. Green and Phoenix offered user-friendly 12-word seed phrases; while Blixt; Mutiny and Zeus provided 24-word seeds. Green's ""forced backup"" was a notable security feature. Cloud backups raised concerns about user data security; as some wallets offered this option. App lock preferences and the availability of separate on-chain Bitcoin wallets were also considered. Phoenix topped the rankings for its overall performance and reliability; followed by Mutiny for its user-friendliness.

38,https://www.coindesk.com/learn/a-beginners-guide-to-ai-tokens/,CoinDesk,article,A Beginner’s Guide to AI Tokens,AI tokens will play an integral role in the adoption of machine learning models in the blockchain industry. Understanding AI Crypto Tokens How Do AI Tokens Work? Top 5 AI Tokens Final Words,Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming many industries; and the crypto space is no exception. With this convergence of blockchain and AI; we’re seeing the rise of unique digital assets; AI crypto tokens. In this beginner’s guide to AI tokens; we will explain what they are; how they work; and list some of the most prominent AI cryptocurrencies in the market. This is partner content sourced from Laura Shin’s Unchained and published by CoinDesk. AI tokens are cryptocurrencies that support AI-based projects; applications; and services within the blockchain ecosystem. AI tokens play three pivotal roles; the first is facilitating transactions. They are the medium of exchange within AI-powered platforms. With them; users can pay for services; access data; and participate in the platform’s activities. Additionally; they are crucial in enabling protocol governance. Some of these tokens confer governance rights to their holders; empowering holders to participate in decision-making processes shaping the development and direction of the AI project or platform. Finally; they incentivize users to contribute towards the growth of the AI protocol/project. These may receive rewards in tokens for contributing data; providing computational resources; or developing AI applications. AI crypto tokens typically work in the following ways: Specifics can vary widely depending on the project. Each AI token system is designed with its own rules and purposes. The crypto AI landscape is rapidly evolving; and many projects are coming up to address various aspects of the space. Here are the top five leading AI tokens measured by market capitalization. The Injective Chain is a layer-2 decentralized exchange and derivatives trading platform powered by the INJ token. It enables advanced trading tools like margins/leverage; using AI for optimized order execution; strategy testing; and predictive analytics. At the time of writing; INJ was the biggest AI token with a market cap of $1.418B. The Graph (GRT) is an indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data; allowing for its easy querying for AI analytics. GRT is the second-largest AI token by market cap ($1.379B at the time of writing) and coordinates the decentralized network of nodes (Indexers). These earn the rights to index and serve application data by staking their GRT. Render Token enables a decentralized GPU cloud computing network for high-demand AI/ML training/rendering tasks. Users stake and lock up RNDR for access to GPUs. The project rewards Render Farm suppliers in RNDR for leasing out graphics horsepower capacity. RNDR has a market cap of $1.22B at the time of writing. The Theta token (THETA) powers the Theta decentralized video delivery network and is the fourth largest AI and big data token; with a market cap of $960M at the time of writing. It aims to provide improved video streaming quality and reduced costs through AI and ML innovations. Users and relay nodes earn THETA for sharing bandwidth resources. The Oasis Network uses a token-incentivized architecture to enable privacy-preserving AI computations on blockchain. ROSE tokens; which have a market cap of $567M at the time of writing; coordinate the network of nodes; providing secure computing via technologies like Intel SGX; differential privacy; and federated learning. As blockchain platforms aim for large-scale adoption; AI innovations will be critical for unlocking new capabilities and efficiencies. Specialized AI tokens help coordinate the incentives and collaboration necessary for advancing AI in a decentralized context. These have strong potential as the tokenization of ML processes grows on-chain. But the category remains technically complex and volatile; as with most crypto. Therefore; investor due diligence before their adoption remains vital. Disclosure Please note that our privacy policy; terms of use; cookies; and do not sell my personal information has been updated.

39,https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-crypto-otc-desks-and-how-do-they-work/,CoinDesk,article,What Are Crypto OTC Desks And How Do They Work?,Cryptocurrency OTC desks play an essential role in facilitating large cryptocurrency trades in the global crypto markets. What Are Crypto OTC Desks? How Do Cryptocurrency OTC Desks Work? Why Are OTC Desks Important in Crypto? Pros and Cons of Using OTC Desks in Crypto The Bottom Line,Crypto OTC desks play an important role in facilitating large cryptocurrency purchases and sales. Read on to learn what crypto OTC desks are; how they work; and why they play an essential role in the global crypto markets. This is partner content sourced from Laura Shin’s Unchained and published by CoinDesk. Over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks facilitate trading between two parties without revealing information about the trade to the public via an exchange orderbook or otherwise. The OTC desk acts as a matchmaker enabling high-volume transactions between buyers and sellers. During an OTC trade; the two parties agree on a purchase price before they can complete the transaction. The trades can be crypto-to-crypto or fiat-to-crypto. OTC desks differ from traditional exchanges in terms of transaction transparency. A crypto exchange like Kraken or Binance acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers. Transactions are executed via an orderbook for everyone to see. Conversely; crypto OTC trading is relatively opaque since no one beyond the transacting parties is aware of the price and volume of assets being traded. Moreover; OTC trades are typically insulated from wider market fluctuations that occur on exchanges. There are two types of OTC desks: principal and agency. Principal desks assume the risk to the buyer by using their funds to purchase whatever asset the buyer requires. For instance; a bitcoin whale looking to make a large bitcoin purchase will request a quote from the OTC desk; and they will respond with a price based on prevailing market conditions. The buyer can choose to accept the offer or make a reasonable counter. Should the buyer accept the proposed price; the OTC desk is responsible for sourcing and delivering the BTC to the buyer as per the legal contract signed beforehand. Agency desks; on the other hand; don’t assume the market risk since they don’t put up their own money for transactions. Instead; they act as an intermediary to broker a deal on behalf of the buyer. They will charge a brokerage fee for this service. Crypto OTC desks exist to enable large investors; such as early adopters; high-net-worth individuals; and institutional investors; to buy and sell large amounts of cryptocurrencies without alerting the market about their intention or transaction. If you try to buy 1;000 BTC on a regular crypto exchange; you will run into several problems. A key challenge is that the chances of finding someone selling that amount at any given time on a single exchange are slim. You will have to opt to spread the purchases across several sellers. The problem that arises is you may end up making some of the purchases at a significantly higher price. Of course; you may be able to avoid this altogether and spread the purchase across several exchanges; but this will be time-consuming and costly. Moreover; you will show the entire market that you are a large buyer or seller; which will most likely lead to a worse execution price. Crypto OTC desks remove the uncertainty and risk for investors looking to buy or sell large volumes of crypto. Here are some of the benefits and challenges of using crypto OTC desks. Large crypto investors looking to buy and sell substantial volumes of cryptocurrency prefer the crypto OTC market over trading on crypto exchanges. Most whales keep their transactions off exchange order books to avoid the market moving against them when they want to transact.

40,https://www.coindesk.com/sponsored-content/taking-phemex-coos-pulse-after-the-launch-of-phemexpulse/,CoinDesk,article,Taking Phemex COO’s Pulse after the launch of PhemexPulse,,Sponsored Content Phemex has surged over the past year to become one of the world’s leading digital asset exchanges for both spot and futures transactions. It led the way in copy trading; bridged the gap between centralization and decentralization; and most recently; broke new ground with the launch of its revolutionary social trading platform. This innovative platform is crafted to bring the crypto community together; rewarding users for their regular online engagements with tangible benefits. The introduction of PhemexPulse has sparked considerable buzz within the online sphere. CoinDesk reached out to Phemex COO Stella Chan to talk about the inspiration driving the development of PhemexPulse and the strategic moves the company plans to make in fostering dynamic and engaged communities. Thank you for the congratulations! The launch of PhemexPulse has indeed stirred up considerable conversation among crypto enthusiasts. Users have discovered in PhemexPulse a vibrant platform that not only facilitates community engagement but also rewards their participation; creating a unique and interactive experience within the digital asset space. PhemexPulse has become a hub of activity with 160 groups formed by KOLs [key opinion leaders] and content creators in just two weeks. Users love that the platform allows them to continue their usual online activities – like following expert trading tips and engaging in trend discussions with peers – while earning rewards for their participation. And by rewards; we're talking substantial incentives: a daily prize pool of 9;000 PT. [Phemex Tokens; or PT; are the exchange’s native coins.] PT is fundamentally linked to our growing Web3 ecosystem and offers substantial promise for traders. Therefore; we are confident that the prize pool will strongly appeal to our community. The landscape is indeed crowded with social networking platforms that users frequent; particularly during a bull market. PhemexPulse; though; distinguishes itself by not only rewarding users for their consistent online engagement but also by fostering a closer relationship between KOLs and their followers within a conversational environment. It offers a compelling chat-to-earn program for active participation that integrates seamlessly with our Web3 ecosystem. Social trading is gaining significant traction and is expected to be a driving force in the upcoming bull market. While current offerings provide a preview of SocialFi's capabilities; there remains a void for a truly Web3-native social platform that prioritizes community interaction. PhemexPulse fills this niche by delivering an authentic; on-the-ground perspective of the crypto market's pulse through peer discussions and activities. Unlike other social trading platforms that focus solely on incentivizing trading; our approach is to cultivate a spirit of collaboration. We aim to foster grassroots innovation within PhemexPulse through Pulse Groups; where the ideas and contributions of any member can be recognized and developed into projects that benefit from a fair launch process; ensuring a level playing field for all. We understand that KOLs have a variety of platforms to connect with their audience. Yet these platforms often dictate the terms of content creation; while PhemexPulse embraces Web3 principles to return control and ownership to the users. Collaborations and engagements within the PhemexPulse ecosystem directly translate into rewards. Our platform is designed to facilitate community contributions and the accumulation of tokens. For KOLs; monetizing their influence is as straightforward as establishing their own Web3 group on PhemexPulse; with funding from Phemex. By creating a group and fostering dialogue with their followers – through quality content and trading insights – KOLs can earn daily rewards in PT; based on their points accrued. PhemexPulse enables KOLs to excel by leveraging their strengths: leading and engaging with their audience. It removes barriers to community interaction; while Phemex provides the means to convert their influence into tangible PT wealth. We believe this model of engagement; unshackled from the confines of traditional social media and coupled with a reward system intrinsic to Web3; will forge new opportunities for KOLs. On PhemexPulse we also provide them an avenue to unveil their exclusive inscriptions and share with their fans. These assets hold great potential and represent a mutually beneficial opportunity for both the KOLs and their followers to possess and exchange. Inscriptions; akin to NFTs; are unique digital assets recorded directly onto the blockchain. Creators can craft these inscriptions and offer them to their followers; who can mint; own and trade them. On PhemexPulse; for instance; crypto influencers act as content creators and can launch their distinct ordinals through our inscription marketplace; allowing the value of each to be shaped by their community's demand. Supporters can engage with and back their preferred influencers on PhemexPulse by acquiring these inscriptions. Inscriptions on PhemexPulse are a testament to the platform's foundational principles. PhemexPulse thrives on the creation of decentralized communities; spearheaded by KOLs. Within these groups; members have the freedom to collaborate and initiate their Web3 projects; enjoying full autonomy. We promote the development of distinctive group cultures and support the creation of community tokens through inscriptions; to enhance group solidarity and cohesion. Our team has dedicated significant effort to devising a scoring system that genuinely benefits our users. We are committed to ensuring that their contributions are recognized and rewarded fairly. We have developed a system designed to enhance user engagement on PhemexPulse and the Phemex trading platform; aiming to forge a comprehensive hub that addresses users' trading and social interaction needs; empowering them through their activities on our platform. In tune with our community-focused approach; we've decided to restructure the PhemexPulse scoring system to better align with user feedback. The newly launched mechanism will emphasize fairness while introducing gamified elements. Within PhemexPulse; users can earn points through a variety of actions; including messaging within groups; executing trades and referring new users. Reward points have no expiration date; providing ongoing value for our users' trading efforts. Additionally; we've introduced Raffle Fuel points; adding an extra dimension to our rewards system. Raffle Fuel points can be accrued through various trading activities on Phemex. The proportion of Reward and Raffle Fuel points compared to the total available points will determine the users’ PT payout. The total prize pool for PhemexPulse is a remarkable 50 million PT. With our updated scoring system; we're allocating 9;000 PT each day from our prize pool for distribution throughout this round. I must add that we have revamped the scoring system in response to our users' feedback; who are at the forefront of our efforts. We will continue to listen to their needs and make the necessary adjustments to the scoring system in the next rounds to ensure that they are rewarded fairly for their interactions. Yes; we have so many exciting opportunities for traders. I mentioned earlier that PhemexPulse hosts an inscription marketplace where KOLs list their exclusive ordinals for minting; holding and trading. These limited edition assets allow users to own valuable items from top crypto figures and open up additional profit avenues. Notably; crypto influencer Ben Armstrong's ordinals on PhemexPulse saw astonishing growth within the first week of its release; driving real value for its holders. We've also recently updated the qualifications for becoming a PhemexPulse group owner; moving beyond the initial requirement of having at least 500 Twitter followers. We aim to make PhemexPulse a hub for all who are shaping Web3 and contributing uniquely to the crypto world. With these inclusive criteria; we aim to draw a variety of visionary leaders. We invite content creators to join us in steering the future of crypto.

41,https://www.coindesk.com/sponsored-content/influencer-achieves-significant-growth-through-inscriptions-on-phemex/,CoinDesk,article,Influencer Achieves Significant Growth Through Inscriptions on Phemex,,Sponsored Content Phemex; a leading digital asset exchange; recognizes the pivotal role that platforms play as trusted partners in nurturing crypto communities. That’s why it has a detailed plan to ensure its traders are united and empowered. The team behind Phemex has recently rolled out its new social trading feature; PhemexPulse; and it swiftly grabbed the crypto space’s attention. Intrinsically linked to the Web3 ecosystem; PhemexPulse offers a lucrative daily earning scheme that turns your routine social interactions into crypto rewards. However; the appeal of PhemexPulse extends beyond its rewards scheme; giving back to users for their engagement. The platform also features a unique inscription marketplace; where key opinion leaders (KOLs) can release exclusive inscriptions for their followers to mint; collect and trade. Ben Armstrong; a prominent figure in the crypto world; was the first to introduce his inscriptions on PhemexPulse; which led to an impressive surge in value of over 7;296% within the initial post-launch hours. This momentum was sustained over the next five days; culminating in a new all-time high (ATH) on March 20; representing a 56% increase from its initial peak. This remarkable growth translated into a cumulative 11;400% gain for the asset holders. In just one week's time; a user who started by minting 10 inscriptions; earning them 10 PT on day one; has experienced a staggering growth; with their holdings skyrocketing to 1000 PT. “Ben has long been a pivotal influencer within the crypto sphere; offering seasoned advice to crypto enthusiasts;” says Phemex COO Stella Chan. “His decision to release his inscriptions on PhemexPulse was met with enthusiasm; as the community eagerly seized the opportunity to acquire them.” Before we get too far ahead of ourselves; though; let’s assume not everyone knows what inscriptions – and their related assets; ordinals – are. They’ve only been around for about a year. They’re basically NFTs predicated on bitcoin. Ordinals are a system for ordering sats – that is; bitcoin fractions – in a way that renders them non-fungible. Inscriptions; then; are the contents of the ordinal NFT. They can be images; videos; texts or any other data. On PhemexPulse; KOLs act as content creators and can also launch their distinct ordinals through an inscription marketplace; allowing the community’s aggregate demand to determine the value of each. Supporters vote with their wallets by acquiring these inscriptions to engage with and back their preferred influencers on PhemexPulse. Recently; Armstrong – who has 100;000 YouTube followers – introduced his exclusive inscriptions on PhemexPulse; limiting ownership to just 600 enthusiasts; with no more than 10 inscriptions per person. Scarcity tends to drive up prices; so the market met this release with an immediate surge. “Ben’s inscriptions are a testament to the explosive potential in this space;” according to Chan. “At Phemex; we're not just strengthening community ties by facilitating deeper connections with leading crypto figures; but also providing a gateway to a vibrant market.” KOLs including Armstrong can nest pretty much any kind of data they want in these NFTs. Some might be collectible in their own right with no intrinsic value beyond the influencer’s fandom – but they might still be fun and lucrative to acquire. Others; though; could conceivably contain investment tips; instructions to access insider-only coin drops or other opportunities to earn. And there’s a potential early-adopter benefit to acquiring inscriptions before anyone else has even heard of them. The value of inscriptions on PhemexPulse are measured in PT; Phemex’s native coin. While Armstrong deserves credit for paving the way; the inscription market has a lot of growth potential for other influencers looking to get in on the ground floor. KOLs can monetize their influence on PhemexPulse simply by creating their own Web3 group; funded by Phemex. By attracting followers with top-notch content and trading tips; these influencers and their followers can unlock daily PT rewards based on their accumulated points. Indeed; the landscape is crowded with various social networking platforms that users frequent; particularly during a bull market. However; PhemexPulse distinguishes itself by not only rewarding users for their consistent online engagement; but also by fostering a closer relationship between KOLs and their followers within a conversational environment. It has already cultivated a dynamic marketplace where unique creations can be minted; held and valued. Phemex is now inviting more content creators to join PhemexPulse and establish their own groups; capitalizing on the myriad opportunities that both they and the market offer.
